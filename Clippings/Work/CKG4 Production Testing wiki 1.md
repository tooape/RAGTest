# [CKG4 Production Testing](https://wiki.corp.adobe.com/display/adobesearch/CKG4+Production+Testing)

[[October 14, 2025]] 

## Summary
This document outlines the plan to prepare the [[Intent AI Home|CKG4]] graph for production use. The primary goal is to ensure [[Intent AI Home|CKG4]] is ready for \\"prime time\\" through two [[Evaluation]] methods: assessing the quality of graph nodes and edges, and evaluating the end-to-end performance in specific use cases.

A contribution model allows capability teams to suggest changes, with governance handled by the [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] & intent team. To focus efforts, the graph is categorized into four tiers of importance, from a manually curated set of \\"Adobe Ecosystem\\" nodes (Tier 1) to the full graph (Tier 4), each receiving a different level of scrutiny.

Use case [[evaluation]] is prioritized, starting with text-heavy Document Cloud ([[Acrobat|DC]]) applications like [[Recommendations Home|contextual recommendations]] and unified search. The plan details three main deliverables: a production-ready tiered graph, tooling for graph edits and visualization, and comprehensive [[evaluation]] reports. A milestone-based timeline targets completion by late November 2025. The document also highlights current gaps in tooling, particularly the need for an end-to-end debugging system and a graph browser. 

## Highlights
> 

## Details
- **Goal**: Make [[Intent AI Home|CKG4]] production-ready through graph quality and end-to-end use-case [[Evaluation|evaluations]].
- **Graph Prioritization**: The graph is divided into four tiers for focused testing, from manually curated (Tier 1) to fully automated checks (Tier 4).
- **Use Case Focus**: Initial testing prioritizes high-impact, text-based Document Cloud ([[Acrobat|DC]]) use cases, like [[Recommendations Home|Contextual Recommendations]] and [[Recommendations Home|Unified Search]].
- **Key Deliverables**: The project aims to deliver a production-ready graph, tooling for graph management, and [[evaluation]] reports.
- **Tooling Gaps**: There is a critical lack of tooling for end-to-end inference debugging and graph visualization/navigation.
