# [Growing and Caring for Aeonium Plants](https://www.thespruce.com/growing-aeonium-plants-1402873)

[[September 28, 2025]] 

This page provides a comprehensive guide on how to grow and care for Aeoniums, also known as tree houseleeks.

Key care instructions include:

*   **Light:** Full to partial sunlight, with light shade needed in hot conditions.
*   **Soil:** Sandy loam or regular potting mix amended with perlite, avoiding typical succulent/cactus mix as they need more moisture.
*   **Water:** Keep soil moist but not waterlogged, allowing it to dry out an inch or two between waterings (less during summer/winter dormancy).


**Highlights**
> These are rather slow-growing plants and may take as many as five years before they produce the little bunches of flowers from the center of the rosettes.
> 
> - Keep your aeonium plant in full or partial sunlight
> 
> - Keep soil moist but not wet or waterlogged

> 
> Aeonium prefer a Mediterranean climate that is not too warm or too cold. If grown in containers, take them inside before the first frost. This plant is hardy to 25-30°F.
> 
> Treat the plant with a spray of water or mild [insecticidal soap](https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-use-insecticidal-soap-1902893) to remove these insects.
