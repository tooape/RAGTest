# [Journey of a single token through the LLM Architecture](https://vizuara.substack.com/p/journey-of-a-single-token-through)

[[October 31, 2025]] 


## Summary
Traces a token's journey through an LLM: from isolation & ID assignment to token/positional embeddings, then through multiple Transformer Blocks (attention, FFN, normalization, dropout) to the output layer for next token prediction.
- Token embeddings convert words to numerical vectors (e.g., 768-D for GPT-2 Small).
- Positional embeddings encode word order.
- Multi-Head Attention captures relationships between words.
