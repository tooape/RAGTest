# [Claude 4 prompt engineering best practices](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-4-best-practices)

[[September 29, 2025]] 

This guide outlines prompt engineering techniques for Claude 4 models (Opus 4.1, Opus 4, Sonnet 4.5, and Sonnet 4) to achieve optimal results.

Key principles include:
- Being explicit with instructions to enhance results.
- Adding context or motivation to help Claude understand goals.
- Being vigilant with examples and details to align with desired behaviors.

Critical capabilities and best practices:
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 excels at long-horizon reasoning and state tracking, particularly across multiple context windows, and benefits from structured state management (e.g., JSON for data, Git for tracking).
- It supports highly efficient parallel tool execution, which can be optimized with explicit instructions.
- Specific guidance is provided for tasks like research, subagent orchestration, document creation, and mitigating hallucinations in agentic coding, often emphasizing clear, direct prompts and structured approaches.
