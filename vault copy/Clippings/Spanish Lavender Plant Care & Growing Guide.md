# [Spanish Lavender: Plant Care & Growing Guide](https://www.thespruce.com/spanish-lavender-growing-guide-5202208)

[[September 28, 2025]] 

This page provides a comprehensive guide on how to grow and care for Spanish lavender (_Lavendula stoechas_).

Key care requirements and characteristics include:
*   It thrives in full sun, hot, dry climates, and well-draining, acidic to neutral soil.
*   It requires infrequent watering and no fertilization.
*   It is toxic to pets and should be overwintered indoors in colder regions (below USDA Zone 8).


**Highlights**
> - Water infrequently and do not let the plant sit in soggy soil; Spanish lavender hates wet feet.
> 
> Abstain from fertilizing Spanish lavender.
> 
> Spanish lavender is much more cold-sensitive than other, hardier varieties. That said, it should be overwintered indoors if you live in a colder region (below Zone 8). If you reside in Zone 8 or above, you can simply insulate your Spanish lavender outdoors during wintertime with an additional layer of mulch to protect the root system. Only water if the winter is exceptionally dry and keep your plants in a spot that gets lots of light.
