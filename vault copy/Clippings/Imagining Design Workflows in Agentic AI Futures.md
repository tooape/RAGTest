As designers become familiar with Generative AI, a new concept is emerging: Agentic AI. While generative AI produces output in response to prompts, agentic AI systems promise to perform mundane tasks autonomously, potentially freeing designers to focus on what they love: being creative. But how do designers feel about integrating agentic AI systems into their workflows? Through design fiction, we investigated how designers want to interact with a collaborative agentic AI platform. Ten professional designers imagined and discussed collaborating with an AI agent to organise inspiration sources and ideate. Our findings highlight the roles AI agents can play in supporting designers, the division of authority between humans and AI, and how designers' intent can be explained to AI agents beyond prompts. We synthesise our findings into a conceptual framework that identifies authority distribution among humans and AI agents and discuss directions for utilising AI agents in future design workflows.


**Highlights**
> Participants suggested that AI tools could adapt to a designer’s
[[Style Home|style]] and preferences over time, becoming more aligned with the
designer’s creative goals. This may allow AI to offer suggestions
that fit the designer’s evolving [[Style Home|style]], expanding the conceptual
space in personalised directions. They suggested that “...[If AI]
is able to record and eventually remember the things that you’re
doing right now. That might be helpful for a later generation of new
ideas based on whatever you were browsing...’’ (SC-11: A- Frank).
That is, AI agents could guide designers by reminding them what
they were previously browsing and providing alternative ideas and
suggestions based on their past search.
However, Ben suggested that AI agents may “show what could
be good to do, but this would probably only be in terms of suggestions,
or in a way that you kind of peripherally get this information.” (SC
20: A- Ben). The designer should therefore have the opportunity to
take action rather having tasks forced on them by AI agents.
These responses indicate that designers envision that AI agents
could support designers by maintaining contextual awareness,
learning from designers’ [[Style Home|style]] and preference, and guiding
designers to stay on track.
