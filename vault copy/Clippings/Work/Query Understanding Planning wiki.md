# [Query Understanding Planning](https://wiki.corp.adobe.com/display/adobesearch/Query+Understanding+Planning)

[[October 14, 2025]] 

## Summary
This document outlines a plan to improve and expand [[Query Understanding]] (QU) systems for search and prompt capabilities across various Adobe products. The plan is structured around five major categories of deliverables:

1.  **D1: Use Case Integrations:** Integrating and evaluating [[Query Understanding|QU]] models (like Asset Affinity, [[NER & SRL|SRL]], and Intent Action) in products such as [[Acrobat|DC]] Search, [[Express]] Agents, and [[Lr Home|Lightroom]] Search.
2.  **D2: Model Expansion:** Generalizing models to work across different domains and products.
3.  **D3: Improvements and Optimizations:** Enhancing model performance by reducing latency, exploring non-LLaMA alternatives, and unifying text and [[Multimodal intent|multimodal]] models.
4.  **D4: Tooling Improvement:** Developing better internal tools for data generation, training, and [[evaluation]] to speed up development.
5.  **D5: Service Operational Excellence:** Improving service quality and reliability through comprehensive testing, code refactoring, and API enhancements.

The work is sequenced into five milestones with target completion dates from November 2025 to March 2026, creating a clear roadmap for development and deployment. 

## Highlights
