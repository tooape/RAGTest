# High Output Management - Andy Grove
---

## Overview

**Author**: Andy Grove (former CEO of Intel)

**Publication**: 1983 (remains highly relevant)

**Core Premise**: Apply manufacturing principles to management. Everything is a process that can be optimized for output. Management is about leverage - doing the few activities that multiply team performance.

**Why This Book**: Old but gold. Very practical, systems-oriented approach. Introduces OKRs (Objectives and Key Results). Cult classic in Silicon Valley - praised by Zuckerberg, Evan Williams, Brian Chesky.

## Core Principles

### Manager's Output Formula

```
Manager's Output = Output of their organization + Output of neighboring organizations under their influence
```

**Key insight**: Your job is not your personal output - it's enabling collective output.

Management is about increasing performance, applying manufacturing principles with output-oriented approach.

### Everything is Process

**Manufacturing mindset**:
- Model everything as repeatable production process
- Understand elements: inputs, outputs, timing, limiting steps, quality controls, variability
- Create and improve the "machinery" to fulfill organizational goals

**Application**: Even creative work (PM, design, engineering) can benefit from process thinking - identify bottlenecks, reduce variability in quality, optimize handoffs.

## High Leverage Management Activities

### 1. Training
**Highest leverage activity a manager can do**

Example calculation:
- Manager spends 12 hours preparing training
- Delivers to 10 team members
- Increases output by 1% on average
- Result: 200 hours of increased output

**Why it matters**: Scales your knowledge across the team, multiplies your impact.

### 2. One-on-One Meetings

**Structure**:
- **Subordinate's meeting** - they set agenda and tone
- Agenda provided ahead of time (manager prepares)
- Topics to cover:
  - What's happened since last meeting
  - Future plans
  - General problems
  - **Very important**: Potential problems (early warning)

**Not status updates** - that's a waste of time.

### 3. Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)

**Critical concept**: Someone's competence is task-specific, not universal.

Example:
- High TRM in sales → Low TRM when promoted to management
- Expert IC → Novice manager

**Management approach must match TRM**:
- Low TRM: More direction, frequent check-ins
- High TRM: Autonomy, strategic guidance

**Application for Francois/Eshan**: Even if they're senior PMs, they may have low TRM in areas you haven't seen yet. Assess per task, not per person.

### 4. Managerial Leverage

"The art of management lies in the capacity to select from the many activities of seemingly comparable significance the one or two or three that provide leverage well beyond the others and concentrate on them."

**Not all work is equal**:
- Doing IC work yourself: Low leverage
- Training 10 people: High leverage
- Removing a systemic blocker: Very high leverage
- Jumping into firefighting: Usually low leverage

**Practice**: Before doing anything, ask "Is this high leverage?" If not, delegate or skip.

## OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)

Grove introduced this framework (later popularized by Google).

**Structure**:
- **Objective**: Qualitative goal (where you're going)
- **Key Results**: Quantitative measures (how you know you got there)

**Focus principle**: "The one thing an MBO system should provide par excellence is focus, and this can only happen if we keep the number of objectives small."

**Rule**: 3-5 OKRs maximum. More than that = no focus = nothing gets done.

## Planning

**Why plan?**
- Not because plans are accurate (they're not)
- Because the process forces you to think through trade-offs
- Creates shared understanding across team
- Makes pivots faster (you already considered alternatives)

"Plans are worthless, but planning is everything." - Eisenhower (quoted by Grove)

## Application to PM Management

**Immediately applicable**:
- **TRM assessment**: Don't assume Francois/Eshan have high TRM everywhere
- **1:1 structure**: Let them drive, focus on potential problems
- **Leverage thinking**: Stop doing IC work, focus on training/unblocking
- **OKRs for team**: Define 3-5 clear objectives, not 20

**Systems thinking for SDC**:
- Map the "production process" for Intent, Recs, Evals
- Where are bottlenecks? (Dependencies on other teams? Data access? Review cycles?)
- What's the quality control? (Evaluation frameworks)
- Reduce variability: Standardize handoffs, clear interfaces
