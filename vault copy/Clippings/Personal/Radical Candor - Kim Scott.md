# Radical Candor - Kim Scott
---

## Overview

**Author**: Kim Scott

**Core Premise**: To be a good boss, you must Care Personally AND Challenge Directly. Framework for giving effective feedback without being an asshole or avoiding hard conversations.

**Why This Book**: Best feedback framework for new managers. Caveat: Take the "radical" part with grain of salt in corporate environments - adapt to context.

## The Two Core Dimensions

### 1. Care Personally
- See team members as human beings
- Keep their best interests in mind
- Acknowledge lives and aspirations beyond work
- Find time for real conversations
- Get to know each other at human level

### 2. Challenge Directly
- Provide feedback right away
- Make feedback actionable and specific
- Don't avoid hard conversations
- Address issues before they compound

## The Four Quadrants

### Radical Candor (Care + Challenge)
The goal: High care + high challenge
- Give direct feedback because you care about the person's growth
- Address problems immediately with kindness
- Push people to be better while supporting them

### Ruinous Empathy (Care without Challenge)
**Most common failure mode for new managers**
- Stay silent to avoid hurting feelings
- Let problems fester
- "Nice" but not kind - prevents growth
- Optimizing for being liked over being effective

### Obnoxious Aggression (Challenge without Care)
- Give feedback without showing you care
- "Brutal honesty" without humanity
- Damages relationships
- Better than Ruinous Empathy (at least feedback happens)

### Manipulative Insincerity (Neither Care nor Challenge)
- Don't care enough to challenge directly
- Being fake for political advantage
- Focused on being liked without substance
- Worst quadrant

## Get Stuff Done (GSD) Wheel

Seven sequential steps for team management:
1. **Listen**
2. **Clarify**
3. **Debate**
4. **Decide**
5. **Persuade**
6. **Execute**
7. **Learn**

## Team Member Archetypes

### Rock Stars
- Stable and excel in current roles
- Don't need rapid promotion
- Deep expertise valuable to team
- Need different management than Superstars

### Superstars
- Seek constant challenges
- Rapid growth trajectory
- Need stretch opportunities
- Will leave if not challenged

**Key insight**: Both are valuable, need different approaches.

## Application to PM Management

**Watch for**: Ruinous Empathy is likely failure mode when managing Francois and Eshan
- Don't avoid hard priority conversations
- Give direct feedback early
- Don't optimize for being liked

**Practice now**: Give feedback before becoming manager
- "When you did X, impact was Y, here's why that matters"
- Both positive and constructive
