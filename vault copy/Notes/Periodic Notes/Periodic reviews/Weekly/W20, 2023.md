# Mind dump
---
- I need to think more seriously about leading [[Live Search|search and merch]] as a micro org in it self 
	- How might I scale my team across these issues more effectively 
	- I need to treat [[iMerch Browse]] as the project that it is rather than pretending it's a normal product cycle 
- I should revisit time management, moving to things has been ok ish but i still feel like im losing minutes that become hours and rarley know what to work on 
	- I should tag more aggressively in things not on the theme of the work but on how the work will be done 
		- comms
			- little blasts of messaging 
		- deep thinking
		- personal info [[Commerce/iMerch/meetings/Grooming|grooming]]
