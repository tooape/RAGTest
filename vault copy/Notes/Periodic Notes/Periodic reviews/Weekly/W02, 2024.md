#  Week 1 in Review 
_Imagine you're a consultant who's been hired to assess a week in your life._ _Starting with a brain dump of anything on your mind..._  


## 1. Accomplishments 
_Review completed tasks for the past week_
- Got evals for [[Recommendations Home|contextual images]] 
- Got some roadmap clarification done, and alignment with [[People/Andrei Stefan|Andrei]] 
- getting the evals playbook started 


## 2. Low points 
_What feels disappointing?_ _Why?_
- Still having trouble getting cohesion or buy in 
	- Feel a bit like an uninvited house guest 


## 3. Next week 
_Set objectives or goals for the week ahead_
- Roadmap comms 


## 4. Further out 
_What's on my mind professionally?_ _What's on my mind personally?_ _What did you find exciting this week?_
- Need to get back to the parts of PM I enjoy 
	- I feel very mired in politicking
