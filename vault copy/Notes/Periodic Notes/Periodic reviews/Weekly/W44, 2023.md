#  Week 43 in Review 
_Imagine you're a consultant who's been hired to assess a week in your life._ _Starting with a brain dump of anything on your mind..._  


## 1. Accomplishments 
_Review completed tasks for the past week_



## 2. Low points 
_What feels disappointing?_ _Why?_
- [[Ravindra Sadaphule|Ravindra]] seemed quite critical of the PRDs in my [[CKG EOY 8 week plan|8 week plan]], this made me feel very ineffectual and under performing. I felt like if I was a good PM I wouldn't have that kind of lack of clarity. Even though I understand a lot of the projects are pretty unknown still. 
- Traveling so early in the morning made for a rough day, i felt very foggy and like the day wasn't as effective as I could've been. 


## 3. Next week 
_Set objectives or goals for the week ahead_
- Need to keep thinking about the [[CKG 2024 Strategy notes|2024 strategy]] 
	- how do I get buy in with [[Ritu Goel|Ritu]] on not creating a single list of deliverables for the year. I don't think we'll be afforded the luxury to have that kind of discipline of execution. 
	- 

## 4. Further out 
_What's on my mind professionally?_ _What's on my mind personally?_ _What did you find exciting this week?_
- Need to continue to build my relationship with [[Tracy King|Tracy]]
