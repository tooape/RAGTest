### the sync itself 
Notes on 3.5
- A few moving pieces 
- We're using the 3.4 nodes with the 3.5 associations 
- The reason for this is that we're testing the new sequence architecture to test using one model for any given modality of input 
- until this is proven out, we don't want to spend a bunch of time fine tuning for it 
- Once we have testing, we'd move to this 

Like heardin cats
I need to loosen my grip and live further out in the future, apart from analysis
