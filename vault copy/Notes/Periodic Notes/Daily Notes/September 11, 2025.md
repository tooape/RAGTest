## Lr UXR #meetings

1. Query behavior patterns - How do pros actually search? Single words vs.
   descriptive phrases vs. metadata combinations?
  2. Relevance expectations - When users search "water falls in sunset,"
  what constitutes a good vs. poor result?
  3. Workflow integration - How does search fit into the broader
  culling/rating/organizing workflow?
  4. Failure recovery - What do users do when semantic search doesn't return
   what they expected?
  5. Cross-catalog search needs - How important is finding images across
  different catalogs/projects?
  6. Autocomplete's role in semantic search

  The relevance issues seem particularly acute around compositional queries
  and the balance between semantic understanding vs. exact metadata
  matching.
