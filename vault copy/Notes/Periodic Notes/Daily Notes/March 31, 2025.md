## [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] Survey
Email

Hi, 

I'm sending this to a few stakeholders to open a dialog about their subjective and objective impressions of [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] and [[Intent AI Home|MINT]]. Rather than asking for a survey or jumping straight to a series of calls i'd like to start with just some candid feedback...

*What are some areas where you feel [[Intent AI Home|MINT]] is performing poorly?* *Are there particular use cases you've seen poor performance on?  Are there specific subjects or topics that aren't doing well?* 

Please reply here when you're able to. It will also be very helpful if you're as specific in your feedback as possible. Feel free to include any screenshots or recordings, links to evals, or other examples. I'll compile the results and schedule some follow up conversations with people as needed. 

Thanks, 
Ryan Manor


## [[CKG 4.0]] nodes

### Compound nodes
- List of compound [nodes](https://adobe-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/asrikantan_adobe_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BE0F41E36-A356-4C28-BD30-DCAD228D1DEA%7D&file=decompunded_verified_nodes_20250320_with_babelscape_match_ckg_presence.xlsx&wdLOR=c541913F7-71EC-DD4A-81F0-C89BB901AE71&fromShare=true&action=default&mobileredirect=true)

**Copy written nodes need to be generalized** 
- 1971 Porsche 911 -> vintage sports car
- Autodesk Software -> CAD software
- Dumbledore -> Wizard

**Overly Spesific**
Not sure if this is more of an inference issue, or a graph issue. But I've seen quite a few instance where we're returning overly specific intents. This is especially prominent in photos of people.
- We shouldn't be returning "High School Senior" for a photo of a teenager with a backpack. High School student would be more appropriate. For topics around seniors and graduations, I would expect that to be a separate intent, or a use case for compositionality. 
- There's some use cases around de-biasing which need some consideration. In some prior tests of Artemis, photos of an Indian person would skew results almost entirely towards Indian culture, and had little to do with what the person in the photo was doing or where they were. 


**Odd Results** 
In some instances it seems very apparent that the graph is based on queries or prompts. The names of some nodes are not only specific but not a singular and complete concept, phrase, or idea.

Concepts which need the clarification of a compound term are usually related to contextual clarification. 
- AC Unit 
	- A specific use of air conditioning 
- Animal Crossing Sign
	- A road sign, not the animal crossing a road itself
	- or the video game
- E-Bike
	- A specific kind of bike
