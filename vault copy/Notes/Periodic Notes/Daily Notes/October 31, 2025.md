## Thinking about becoming a manager

### Context & Philosophy
[[Brian Eriksson|Brian]] brought up earlier this week that promotions and movements into management are more **organizationally need-driven than personal accomplishment-driven**. This reframes the opportunity - it's not about "earning" the next level through individual achievement, but about filling a genuine structural gap.

Key insight: You need to be capable *and* organizational space needs to exist. The accomplishment narrative is incomplete without the structural component.

### Why
Ritu and her org needs some more structure due to the breadth of current in flight work.
- I can help ease some of the manager load and help her focus on top line strategy
- **[[Brian Eriksson|Brian]]'s explicit framing**: "Ritu needs someone she can trust"
- This is about trust, judgment, and context - not just technical delivery

### Timeline
- **Vipul staff meeting**: End of November 2025
- Would need Ritu to make the pitch to [[Vipul Dalal|Vipul]], [[Ravindra Sadaphule|Ravindra]], and leadership
- Quick move (just bumped L40→L50 in July), but technically lateral so not a blocker

### Who Would I Manage
Eshan and Francois was [[Brian Eriksson|Brian]]'s thought.
[[SDC FY25 Product Stakeholders an_2baf30fd7e5e4dcba3746a10a4f51171-311025-1559-2606.pdf]]

**Francois's portfolio** (AI Foundations focus):
- [[Evaluation|Evals]]
- Relevance workstream
- Language AI

**Eshan's portfolio** (Product/integration focus):
- EDU
- Autocomplete
- Discovery Guidance

My org would be:
- Intent & Language
- Recs
- Disc Guidance
- Autocomplete
- Evals & relevance

Might give intent to Rhut, since he's already focused on the agent and assistant work.

### The Narrative
**"Ritu's org needs it and it makes enough sense"** - not perfect org design, but urgent need + qualified person + sufficient coherence.

**Coherence thread**: AI/ML intelligence capabilities across the stack
- Francois builds foundational models and eval frameworks
- Eshan applies intelligence to user experiences
- Both work on AI-powered capabilities (models vs. applications)

**Why this works**:
- ✅ Common reporting line (both already report to Ritu)
- ✅ AI/ML domain expertise applies to both
- ✅ Already embedded in the context (Intent, Recs, [[Query Understanding|QU]])
- ✅ Organizational load is real (Ritu's span unsustainable)
- ✅ Trust factor ([[Brian Eriksson|Brian]]'s explicit endorsement)
- ✅ No external hire ramp time needed

**What it's NOT**:
- ❌ Perfectly themed McKinsey org chart
- ❌ Natural career progression everyone saw coming

### The Pitch Elements
1. **Organizational need is real**: Ritu's span too broad, needs structure
2. **Trust/judgment**: [[Brian Eriksson|Brian]]'s "Ritu needs someone she can trust" framing - this is about handling ambiguity, discretion, alignment
3. **Delivery proof point**: [[Lr Home|Lr]] semantic search shipped this year (Brian called this out as big win)
4. **Cross-functional credibility**: [[CKG 4.0]] infrastructure work with [[Subhajit]] (potential positive vote with [[Ravindra Sadaphule|Ravindra]])
5. **Context preservation**: Already deep in these programs - no 6+ month ramp

### Key Relationships & Votes
- **[[Brian Eriksson|Brian]]**: Explicit endorsement, cited Lr semantic search delivery
- **[[Subhajit]]**: Recent collaboration on graph work (merging offshoots, contributor flows, validation frameworks) - could influence [[Ravindra Sadaphule|Ravindra]]'s vote
- Need approval from: [[Vipul Dalal|Vipul]], [[Ravindra Sadaphule|Ravindra]], leadership team
