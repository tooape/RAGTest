## Josh stock sync up #meetings/1x1 

- the stock business logic issue 
	- done by feb 5, pushed to prod then
- Stock asset affinity 
- Other stock needs around intent understanding


stock workstreams
- [[Firefly|genAI]]
- PLG
	- 99% of search asks from here 
	- lots of UX polish

low video marketshare as compared to images, goal to grown this. 
Leaky bucket - high user churn 

60% of searches are for "all", so much engagement comes from images tho. 
- this is the asset type affinity work

**Focuses for 2025**
1. ==drive engagement with video==
	1. 90% of their videos are less than 1min
2. also some geo exp improvement 
	- fr, brz, de, kr, jp
	- no india focus rn 
	- query to local affinity, is this query related to local conten. 
		- japanese baseball photos vs american baseball photos
	- They have a region ranker for assets and markets 
		- thai is cheap to make content, but is generic enough to sell in Kr, Jp
		- country focused, but falls back to "region"

problems with A1 for INTL:
- local idioms 
	- big Jp issue
- words / concepts that don't translate
	- holidays 
	- phrases



## Ritu's staff #meetings 

- [x] update [Q1 wiki](https://wiki.corp.adobe.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=adobesearch&title=SDC+Express+Project+X+Prioritization+FY25) for [[January 21, 2025]]


## [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] tech sync #meetings 

Before I pull up this deck i'd like to give some important context. There's a bit of a shift in how the PM org is being strucutred. 
The PMs in Ritu's org will take a sort of T-Shaped ownership model. Where one PM will provide support for a "horizontal" set of technologies which spans multiple capabilities (search, browse, [[Recommendations Home|recs]], assistant). And then one of these capability areas. For me, that means I give PM guidance on [[Intent AI Home|MINT]] and [[ILUP]] as the set of "intent" technologies in SDC, and then I'll also be giving PM oversight on [[Recommendations Home|recommendations]] more broadly across SDC. Other members of Ritu's staff own things like ML ranker, browse experience, etc. 

So that brings us back around to this deck... This deck speaks to SDC's strategic priorities and comes from a capability perspective. The deck is structured around the areas of Search, Browse, and [[Recommendations Home|Recs]]. There's another deck called "assisted creation" which focuses more on the Assistant prototype work. I'll share the full deck out, and you're welcome to read through it. But I'll only be speaking today to the [[Recommendations Home|recs]] sub-section, as I don't have the talk track Andrei, or Francois wrote for the search or browse sections, and these aren't my area of ownership. I'll also focus on the strategy and vision more than a granular roadmap
