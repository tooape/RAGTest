## Lion bridge golden dataset evals #meetings 

Lion bridge is a data set company which will groom and hand check generated datasets. We're looking to divide up a budget of 30k samples across the critical use cases, tasks, and product surfaces (optional) we would want to have this data set for. 

Key components: 
- Product surface 
- Use cases 
	- [[Recommendations Home|Unified search]] 
	- Agents
	- MCP?
- Task 
	1. [[NER & SRL|SRL]]
	2. Topic extraction
	3. Asset [[Core Affinity Framework|affinity]]
	4. [[NER & SRL|NER]]
	5. [[Query Understanding|CAF]]


One note is that they're just going to be grooming a data set that we generate, so we will need to be able to provide clear instructions and 5-10 examples for annotation.
