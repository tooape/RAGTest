## [[Audio|SFX]] and [[Audio|Music]] [[Recommendations Home|recs]] 

When would someone want these things? 
- they're posting it somewhere, it will never be printed. 
- Loops vs lineares 
	- someone making a loop might only want one or two [[Audio|SFX]], and a single [[Audio|music]] track 
	- someone working on linear video might want more 

[[Audio|SFX]] will likley be used to punctuate moments
[[Audio|Music]] will be like background tracks (think kickstart video [[Audio|music]])

The effective corpus for [[Audio|SFX]] is going to be very small, literally 10 or 15 would be fine. 
The corpus for [[Audio|music]] will be larger, but still relatively small unless the user is bringing their own files. 
- A few variations of kickstarter [[Audio|music]] is mostly what they'll want
- unless you're looking for a specific song
