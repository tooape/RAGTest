- [[Prompts for QU testing]]

## [[Lr Home|Lightroom]] question 
If we only migrate active accounts, then the extra assets in the "all" collection will become stale or costly to maintain on legacy stack. Can we just stop indexing these people? Drop them? Migrate them later?

Feng bin has a project to fine tune adobe One V2 for the kinds of cases we're doing poorly on. 
- transformer based ranking 
- Would be good to add this to Lr
