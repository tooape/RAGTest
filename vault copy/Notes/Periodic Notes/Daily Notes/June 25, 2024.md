We have a few updates on our [[Recommendations Home|contextual editor]] [[Recommendations Home|recommendations]] work stream:
1. Discovery between the teams is complete and we're in planning and dev work now
2. Engineering design is approved and the technical breakdown is in progress
3. We've completed our PLA for using the [[Intent AI Home|MINT]] [[Multimodal intent|MultiModal]] foundational model on this use case 
	1. We've also created tooling for flagging and reviewing [[Recommendations Home|recommendations]] if we find anything potentially harmful or offensive.
4. In order to query for the assets in these [[Recommendations Home|recommendations]] we'll need to get the stock index over to [[SDC 2.0]], we're reviewing a proposal with the stock team to accelerate this work in time for August, so far timelines look ok there.
5. We've also made progress on the [[Intent AI Home|MINT]] and Search side 
	1. We've got better [[semantic disambiguation]] in our query so we do a better job of handling things like "bat" the animal vs "bat" the thing you use to hit a ball in a sport
	2. We've gotten a v1 of canvas [[Color]] extraction working, and are testing some asset [[Color]] ranking capabilities now, big thanks to Hep and the [[Color]] team for the help with that tech. We'll start moving into [[Color]] harmonies and pallets next. 


## [[Vic Chen|Vic]] #meetings/1x1 

- Go with incremental updates 
	- don't need authoring UX input 
- A/B test stats 
	- not going to deliver the universe here
	- define a CTR baseline and then set target 
	- they're also thinking of this as a beta
- Curation logic 
	- Less important than relevance right now 
- Golden set for [[Style Home]] and evals 
	- She'll make one 
- Timelines 
	- There's not a date
	- target end for planning is tomorrow 

Floating bar by end of year

She wants the tech roadmap 

- [x] Start a slack DM for the program/standup here
- Engineers are the focus, and then PMs later
