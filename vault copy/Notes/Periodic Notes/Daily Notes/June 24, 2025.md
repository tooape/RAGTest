## [[Ritu Goel|Ritu]] #meetings/1x1 

What should I be focused on now? 
- [[Intent AI Home|SLM]] Req? 
- [[Query Understanding|NER]] req? 
- Is this stuff more important than [[Lr Home|Lr]]? 

**Weekly sync**
Goals: 
- no one is making a hack
- Everyone is aligned on approach 

**[[Intent AI Home|SLM]] and/or [[Query Understanding|NER]]**
Example prompts for each of the asked for NERs
so then the team can say what is [[Query Understanding|NER]] solving, and what is MINT SLM going to solve.
