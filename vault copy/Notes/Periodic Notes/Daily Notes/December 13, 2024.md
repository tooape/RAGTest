## [[Recommendations Home|Contextual recs]] UX study 

[[Vic Chen|Vic]]
- What are users looking for in the all tab?
	- ![[Screenshot 2024-12-13 at 09.45.20.png]]

**Looking for assets**
- squash the different associations and show the assets from them on loop
- This could be done for the asset carousels that are there now

**Looking for topics**
- pills of topics 

**Looking for quick access to lower level tabs**


**Ambient contextualization**

- [x] make [[Recommendations Home|contextual recs]] mocks and put in a wiki page
