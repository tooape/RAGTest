## [[Jing Zheng|Jing]] #meetings/1x1 

- [[Intent Autocomplete]]
	- currently based on behavior or quick actions 
	- How do we use [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] here? 
		- Just show [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] intents as keywords or query completions 
		- Semantic suggestions in AC 
			- not just pre-fix text match 
		- Showing orthogonal types of content 

## [[Brian Eriksson|Brian]] #meetings/1x1 

- His comments on the one pagers 
	- Assistive intent to action flows are going to live or die on how useful they actually are. We need to draw a clear distinction on how we're better than a command pallet or macro search bar
		- We probably aren't there this year. 
		- Concerned the data scientists are jumping the gun and about to make a lot of artists/c-Pros mad. 
	- Drawing a distinction between [[Personalization Home|personalization]] and intent/contextualization. 
- My sub pages on the roadmap
	- [International Intent Understanding](https://wiki.corp.adobe.com/display/adobesearch/International+Intent+Understanding)
	- [User Behavior Driven Intents](https://wiki.corp.adobe.com/display/adobesearch/User+Behavior+Driven+Intents)
	- [Compositional Intents](https://wiki.corp.adobe.com/display/adobesearch/Compositional+Intents)
	- [Intent Services Styles](https://wiki.corp.adobe.com/display/adobesearch/Intent+Services+Styles)

- image associations 
	- use the cat tags to get the recall 
	- visual similarity from stock to the canvas for the ranking

Getting SDC to understand the creative process or workflow, and build that empathy is going to be a series of conversations, not a grand vision that get's worked backwards. I need to get and communicate a user persona.
