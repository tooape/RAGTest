## [[Recommendations Home|Recs]] program sync #meetings 

### [[Style Home|Style]] [[Evaluation|eval]] from last week
Great results, we've got good directional [[Style Home|style]] understanding but because the stock recall is so long for any given query that the relevance tanks. 

#### Next steps for [[Style Home|style]]
- Getting the relevance / recall worked out so that we have a topically relevant list of results 
- Getting our path to prod ironed out: 
	- [[Express]] [[Recommendations Home|contextual recs]] was the hero use case but the relationship with express is poor
		- [[Vic Chen|Vic]] remains interested but her power is diminished now. 
	- [[Photoshop]] wants [[Style Home|style]] and is interested in working w us but they're so early on getting to prod, and may not have the DAU we want. 
	- [[pdf2pres]] may be the best near term route to prod for us now. 

## [[Query Understanding]] Checkin #meetings/pgm 

### My notes
- [QU Project planning wiki](https://wiki.corp.adobe.com/display/adobesearch/Query+Understanding+Project+Planning)
	- [[Query Understanding Project Plan 2025-08-04.pdf]]

[[NER & SRL|SRL]] and Intent action are key to [[Acrobat|DC]] sept release. 
The [unified strategy / "leaderboard"](https://wiki.corp.adobe.com/display/adobesearch/Unified+SLM+Evaluation+Strategy) for SLM eval is made. 
The [Golden dataset](https://wiki.corp.adobe.com/display/adobesearch/Intent+Golden+Datasets) for [[SLM]] [[Evaluation|eval]] is made. 


**Intent Action**
v0 LORA is trained and deployed
- https://wiki.corp.adobe.com/display/adobesearch/Intent+Action+Requirements

Still need parameter extraction for actions. 

### Teams CoPilot notes (Calude summary)
**Intent Action Model**
- Added to Llama 321B, selected 20 tools/actions from 29 available
- Achieved 92.5% classification accuracy on single action prediction
- Created golden eval set with 500 manually verified samples (Suhas)
- Still need parameter extraction for actions

**Golden Data Sets & Evaluation**
- New unified wiki created for golden datasets with human-verified data and statistics
- Allows comparison between training and golden sets
- Suhas working on unified dashboard (ETA: today)
- Multi-label tracking challenges discussed - need precision, recall, F1 metrics for each class

**SRL Progress & Challenges**
- Data set issues identified: queries too verbose, need to focus on P0 fields
- Preparing new simplified data set for improved accuracy
- Venkat emphasized importance of high recall in addition to precision
- Need to address underrepresented samples, track weekly progress

**Asset Affinity Model**
- Creating golden eval set, addressing shorter query issues
- Plan to include more content queries and retrain model
- Express use case prioritized (Rahul/Michael discussion)

**Deployment & Infrastructure**
- Working on automating training/deployment pipeline for faster iterations
- Need robust pipeline with quality gates and multi-version comparison capability
- Mint V2 deployment includes latest SRL model and intent action
- Integrating latest CKG release

**Key Follow-up Tasks**
- Send completed leaderboard/metrics email when Suhas finishes
- Expand SRL golden set with more samples
- Finish new SRL data preparation by Wednesday, train model this week
- Prepare Express golden data set and evaluate current model
- Automate end-to-end pipeline for multiple deployments per week
- Set up AB testing for model version comparison
- Schedule meeting on Express behavioral data utilization


## [[Ayush Jaiswal]] #meetings/1x1 

[[Intent AI Home|CKG]] Alpha 3
- Next steps 

QU + Alpha 3
- Grounding [[SLM]] in [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] 4.0

Evaluating 3.5 vs 4.0 for DC use cases. 
- follow up with jayant on getting the test set

**SRL**
making progress, some challenges
- SRL PRD is kind of thin, not a lot of detail or examples 
	- asset name is a req, but no examples of what that would be, file ext included? just some words? 
	- Clarifications are coming from conversations with Umang, Jay, Tracy on Friday...very informal 
	- Getting training data is easier than figuring out what to train *for*
	- Aligning the use cases with what we want to do

PoC v1.1 is basically done. 

For SRL they're doing a 1-shot, where the things are being inferred on the full query string. Not leveraging NER. So for things like author name or something they're not using the NER for people name we already have.

	- ^ this is what they talked about on friday

Umang kind of feels like Yu Chen and Ayush coming in is a turf war.
