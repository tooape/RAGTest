## Summary of [[Lr Home|lightroom]] bugs 
Lightroom is on a multi-year plan to unify the two desktop apps, into one experience. This necessitates adding some features to Lr cloud to get feature parity with classic. They've identified a few bugs around query behavior that are blocking the implementation of Smart Collections, a feature which takes a rule or filter based approach of categorizing images as they're created or changed into folders.
