[[Lr Home|Lightroom]] CAT, [[Intent AI Home|mint]] indexing 
The question is about for [[Lr Home|Lr]], we're currently indexing: 
- CAT concepts
- [[Intent AI Home|MINT]] scene objects
- [[Intent AI Home|Mint]] intents 

Do we need to query all of these? 
- With CAT we get 25 languages 
- With [[Intent AI Home|MINT]] we get linking into the graph and the babelscape concepts (only if [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] 4.0...)

Their Q4 Prioritization 
- Multiple modules with lower pricing 
	- Lowering the per seat cost from $10k → $5 by offering different modules like just insights, or just creation to bring in more seats per account 
- Expand to self serve for mid market (from current ent focus)
	- Agentic browsers are expected to take over, they want these browsers to be able to spin up on GS quickly 
	- They also see this as the path to expanding into MM, into the marketo and commerce install base

	- paramount

## EDU #meetings 

Mary Cherng

Thinking about education across adobe holistically across adobe, not per product. 
Where before they had been very top down distribution focused by selling to school districts and institutions, they're now going more user segment focused. 

Next gen creators have no idea what adobe is or does, and do not care about Cpro industry conventions. 

Student workflows: 
- Home
- Study 
- Create
- Ideate 

Creating an adobe StudySpace where people add a bunch of docs, links, YT, random shit and then it can product chats, quiz games, flashcards, kahoot, etc 

## [[Recommendations Home|Recs]] standup #meetings 

Judging [[Style Home|style]] vs relevance, what is the hit to [[Style Home|style]] we would stand to get [[Style Home|style]]?

## [[Photoshop]] Strategy #meetings 

[[Jasper]] Spier 

[[Photoshop|Ps Web]] as moved into freemium 

they are focused on a subset of creators who want to reach audiences with authentic original content.

### Agent 
two pillars: 
- Approachable 
	- making Ps less intimidating 
- Inspirational 
	- Can I make cool shit 

landing users in an empty chat is just another "Blank canvas problem" 

"AI forward, embedded intelligence"
Next best step recommendation for agent, recommending the right quick action. 
- making this personalized 
- canvas context 

The focus is on them brining their own images, whole shot image creation isn't a big deal for them.
