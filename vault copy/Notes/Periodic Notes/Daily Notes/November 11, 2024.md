## Getting ready for [[lightroom photo summit]]

### What do I want out of this
I should think beyond lr Semantic Search. What do these people think/do within discovery generally in lr?
What are they looking for? When and why are they looking for it? 




### Questions I want to ask people: 

https://usability.yale.edu/understanding-your-user/user-interviews/user-interview-example-questions

- let's start at the beginning beginning, let's say you've just wrapped a day's work on a project, you've got some shots to add. What's your intake and culling process?
- What kinds of situations would cause you to try to find something in Lr? \
	- When / why are you going back through your catalog? 
- What are you usually looking for in Lr, specific photos or project folders/albums? etc?
- How organized would you say your catalog is? 
	- What kinds of organizational tools do you usually use? (if any lol)
	- When you think of a photo you want to pull up do you usually know right where it is in some folder/album? 
- Let's say you've got something in mind that you want to pull up in lr...Walk me through how you go about finding that. 
	- Desktop
	- Mobile
- Do you Lr search much? Why/why not? 
-

### Roadmapping 
**for [[Intent AI Home|mint]]**
intent protfolio: giving people a full and uniform understanding of intent intel
- dictionarty
- qit
- qps
- MM embeds
- etc

Broad picture - what is SDC intent intel?
- how does user express their intent?
	- text video, photo
	- actions
	- segment and context 

Holistically what we take in, and the intel we can provide from that?
- DME wide intent system, what would that be?
