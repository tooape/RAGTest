## Ritu Message
Hey Ritu, hope you had a nice flight home! Not sure if we'll get a chance to connect on Wednesday so I thought i'd leave a few updates: 

**Lr**
The biggest question here is about their ask for On-Device. They're exploring using AdobeOneMobile for a few non-search features and they seem to be asking us to investigate using this for semantic search? [It's my opinion](https://adobesearch.slack.com/archives/C08CAK3USMP/p1745947727573069) that this is a non-starter, that model is far to small to be effective, and this risks an already packed MAX scope. Slacked Mark Richards to clarify if that is actually what they're asking, but he's at an on-site until later this week. I've also cautioned Peter on the relevance impact of using the mobile size 64 dimension embedding for search. 
On the eng side: we've got the [next steps on relevancy](https://wiki.corp.adobe.com/display/adobesearch/Lightroom+Semantic+Search+Evaluation+Guidelines+and+Plan#LightroomSemanticSearchEvaluationGuidelinesandPlan-Phase2:Ranking&Recallimprovement) planned out, and the client integration work is moving forward. 

**[[Intent AI Home|CKG]] 4.0**
We're well underway on Node Generation, next week we'll begin edge generation. We need to start to build our plan for req'd [[Intent AI Home|MINT]] changes to make use of 4.0, how the client evals and eventual prod cut over to the new graph will work. Kosta and I have talked about this and he's putting some thoughts together to review when I get back. 

**[[Query Understanding|NER]]**
We've got a good working group going to collect NER requirements of folks from eng, plus Tracy, Francois and I. [I've started a page here](https://wiki.corp.adobe.com/display/adobesearch/SDC+Named+Entity+Recognition+FY25) to track our current capabilities, and what the new incoming asks are. 


**Recs**
I'm very worried about Search & All tab. They've stalled on getting us any est on the work for weeks, and I don't get the sense there's a lot of urgency on their side. 
Brian and I have talked about Express's seemingly cold attitude recently, and are pushing them to get dates. 

The silver lining is that [[Recommendations Home|PDF]] folks we spoke to about contextual recs for [[Recommendations Home|PDF]] are very engaged, they got [a POC up and running on desktop app](https://adobesearch.slack.com/archives/C08N5EPNLSG/p1745849751115289) and liked the results. We've been having weekly calls with their PM and eng team, and are [starting to ideate more realistic use cases with them](https://wiki.corp.adobe.com/display/adobesearch/Acrobat+Contextual+Recommendations). They're spinning up a larger POC and eval effort on their side, we've agreed to sync back up next week. 



## [[Lr Home|Lightroom]] Planning

### Relevance
Over the next two weeks there are three goals in relevancy: 
1. **Searching on metadata fields** in addition to tags and embeddings. We're trying to understand the experience of running hybrid queries without [shooting metadata NER](https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/SDC-56129). 
	1. Aperture, Shutter Speed, Focal length, date, and ISO are the most important
		1. Start with field matching in the full hybrid query strategy for the shooting metadata
			1. Recall via BM25 match on these shooting metadata fields, then re-ranking with embeddings 
2. **Testing Capture Date NER for dates**
3. **Start improving recall.** We're looking to start testing dynamic thresholding so we can tune it's recall. 
	1. Testing dynamic thresholding vs an unbounded recall set
4. **Testing orientation, person name, and type NER**

I will update the query list for #1, and #3. 

### Custom Catalogs
We'll use this as a sign up: [Book 2.xlsx](https://adobe-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/p/rmanor/ETBDEJXRaENGvFTojjM-hl4BctUGQk1RAlVzu0vt42hRBA?e=7wcEkb)
I'll send to [[Peter Baust|Peter]], he'll share with [[Lr Home|Lr]] team.

## [[Recommendations Home|Recommendations]] sync #meetings 


Do we have an ask from the [[Express]] PM side for [[Audio|SFX]] [[Recommendations Home|recs]]? 
Will be a lift and shift of the current implementation w adobe research. 
We have a larger corpus. 

**For rec inference** we should be thinking about modalities not surfaces. If some use case has short text, we shouldn’t care if that’s on a template or an extraction from a [[Recommendations Home|PDF]] doc, or a prompt on [[Express]] unified home page. Same with long text, same with image, video, etc… We should have boilerplate methodologies for any given modality which do not change much if at all across product surfaces.
**For rec queries** we may need to tune the behavior of the association query, or the asset query to suit one product or surface vs another and that’s fine. This will be taken case by case.


## Design types in [[CKG 4.0]] chat w [[Arvind]] #meetings/1x1 

**Questions from [slack](https://adobe.enterprise.slack.com/archives/D05SECRMKB5/p1745865911562769):**
1. Do you have any thoughts on the Design Type/Task nodes and their hierarchy?
2. Would they fold under the Template asset type? I think some might have multiple parents. For example, "tiktok video" can have both template and video edges. What do you think?
3. Does [[Express]] maintain this hierarchy somewhere we can keep in sync with? What about other surfaces (like stock)?
	1. Asked for this

## [[Francois Guerin|Francois]] #meetings/1x1 

[AI foundations 1-pager](https://adobe.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/adobesearch/_layouts/15/doc2.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BE21BDA78-D30C-4FBD-9B1B-61A3125BA92D%7D&file=FY25%201-pager%20AI%20Foundations.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)

Might need to work w [[Cherag Aroraa]] on:
- multi langauge spell check which [[Francois Guerin|francois]] is out A/B
- Spellcheck v2 start work
- CAT 

## [[Recommendations Home|PDF]] Contextual [[Recommendations Home|recs]] #meetings 

- Feedback from the integration 
- use case 1: Asset replacement 
- use case 2: paragraph level intent 
- next steps 

Doc summary is 70-80 words
they care more about iamge addition than image replacemnt
