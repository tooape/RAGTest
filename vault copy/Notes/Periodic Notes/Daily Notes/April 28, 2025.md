## Asset affinity 
We have a wiki from [Rahul](https://wiki.corp.adobe.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=~rahgandh&title=Asset+Affinity) outlining some ideas, and [some](https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/SDC-55221) [suggestions](https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/SDC-55032?src=confmacro) from Suhdakar, but we've not completed these investigations, nor are there any complete requirements ( we do have some use [case asks from folks however](https://adobe-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/personal/jsampat_adobe_com/_layouts/15/doc2.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B4647D3B5-44AB-4F2B-A208-ECB0B5A0E727%7D&file=Asset%20Affinity%20Based%20Filtering%20for%20Enterprise%20Search.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1&ct=1745858764586&wdOrigin=OFFICECOM-WEB.START.EDGEWORTH&cid=9bd201eb-a4f2-4a15-b80e-e679b9e9481d&wdPreviousSessionSrc=HarmonyWeb&wdPreviousSession=2ca743ca-4b30-4773-986d-7f3b5ed39f69)).  This line item in the 1-Pager is meant to capture our work on a core model which the respective client teams would take and build on top of for their use case. 


## [[Lr Home|Lightroom]] query readout

Hi all, since this week's sync has been moved out a couple weeks I wanted to share a quick update on the query & relevance front. 
After running a evals over the month of April we've landed on using [[Intent AI Home|MINT]]'s Scene Objects, Lightroom's current tagger, and Concept Auto Tagger (CAT) for single token queries, and AdobeOne embeddings for multi-token queries. This strategy will serve as our relevance baseline, and we'll use it to benchmark our improved performance as we continue to iterate over the summer. I'll share further relevance updates in the next monthly sync. 

A big thanks to everyone who worked on these experiments, and those who lent their time to help us evaluate!

## AI foundations 

**Centralized asset affinity models**
Collecting full requirements, getting user assets

- [user asset use case list from Jay](https://adobe-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/personal/jsampat_adobe_com/_layouts/15/doc2.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B4647D3B5-44AB-4F2B-A208-ECB0B5A0E727%7D&file=Asset%20Affinity%20Based%20Filtering%20for%20Enterprise%20Search.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1&ct=1745858764586&wdOrigin=OFFICECOM-WEB.START.EDGEWORTH&cid=9bd201eb-a4f2-4a15-b80e-e679b9e9481d&wdPreviousSessionSrc=HarmonyWeb&wdPreviousSession=2ca743ca-4b30-4773-986d-7f3b5ed39f69)


## [[Lr Home|Lightroom]] sync with [[Peter Baust|Peter]] #meetings/1x1 

### Notes
Using a smaller AdobeOne ver for some other on device features. Want us to consider same model. Mark is POC on that 

### Progress
- Baseline query
	- Will send an email tomorrow 
- Indexing in prod
	- Test catalog has been re-indexed in prod
		- Hybrid search ranking testing can begin
	- We can index user catalogs now, i'll send instructions on how to get us your catalog ID for indexing 
		- Who should I send this to? 

### Other asks
**Metadata query handling**

Filter by location & camera:
- "query" vs "filter" is mostly a UI distinction
	- we can support both of these in query
		- we're going to test using metadata matching as a query filter using NER instead of a ranking signal
	- We can track showing these as UI filters like in LrD as a separate feature

**Can we get a list of people names?** for NER

### metadata aggregation bucket values cutoffs

**ISO**
(exif:ISOSpeedRatings <= 200) → "Low ISO"
(200 > exif:ISOSpeedRatings < 1600) → "Medium ISO"
(exif:ISOSpeedRatings >= 1600) → High ISO

1. Should we add an "ultra high" or "extended high" bucket? Many modern cameras go well over 12800

**Apreture**
(repo:apertureValueString <= 2.8) → "Shallow Depth of Field"
(2.8 > repo:apertureValueString < 11) → "Normal Depth of Field"
(repo:apertureValueString >= 11) → "Deep Depth of Field"

1. Should we change the cut off for "normal" Dof to start at f8? On anything other than long telephotos f8 will already be quite deep DOF?
	1. Many consumer lenses will top out at f16
2. Should we consider not using this as a filter as the actual depth of field is highly dependent on focal length & focus distance? 
	1. This relationship will also show visually, making our embedding search useful for this case anyway

Both shot at f2.8:

**Focal length**
(FocalLengthIn35mmFilm  OR repo:focalLengthString) <= 35 → "Wide Angle"
(Normal Focal Length = 35 > (FocalLengthIn35mmFilm OR repo:focalLengthString) < 60 ) → "Normal Focal Length"
(FocalLengthIn35mmFilm OR repo:focalLengthString) >= 60 → "Telephoto"


**Shutter Speed**
*(ExposureTime <= 1) -> Bulb?* 
(ExposureTime <= 1/15) → "Slow Shutter Speed"
(1/15 > ExposureTime < 1/100) → "Medium Shutter Speed"
(ExposureTime >= 1/100) → "Fast Shutter Speed"

1. 1/100th is a 1/3rd stop value. It would make more sense to group on full stop values. Can we change 1/100th to 1/125th? 
2. Likewise 1/15th is extremely slow, most people can't hand hold a shot that slow without stabilization. Should we consider changing this to 1/30th or 1/60th and: 
	1. and adding a 4th bucket for values over 1sec?
