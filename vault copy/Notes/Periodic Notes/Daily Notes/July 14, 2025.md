## Contextual recs for stickers 
In conversation w Vic: https://adobesearch.slack.com/archives/D0642PW7K7U/p1752534364046429
- I need to reach out to the eng team to get the observability/splunk dashboard so you have more numbers on the volume
- However, here's the amplitude dashboard with some datapoints in the meantime:
    - [Overall Express _Elements_ search & browse dashboard](https://app.amplitude.com/analytics/adobe/dashboard/evdbrai)
    - Within that, there's a section for "Elements panel search"
        - [GIF search metrics](https://app.amplitude.com/analytics/adobe/chart/vsv43y6s?bulk=true&s.name=User%20Properties&linkingDashboardId=evdbrai&source=dashboard) way lower than other assetTypes in Elements _as of now_. Search-to-placement CTR is 17% for GIFs/Stickers, vs. 42.4% for Icons, just as a comparison point. That being said, right now the volume is very low because of Amplitude's 3 day data lag -- we only just got to 100% today (it started at 1% and ramped up gradually)
- CRs for GIFs and Videos are not pressing for FY25 release. It's more important to come up with a plan / path to get there, and then let leadership know (so basically, perhaps we could aim for a launch/improvement in Q1'26?)
    - BUT if your team feels like the tech is nearly there and it would be integration-ready in Q4, then we could certainly try to take it up asap since Contextual Recs have been effective
