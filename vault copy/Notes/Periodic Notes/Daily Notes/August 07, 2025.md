## [[Photoshop]] next best action [[Recommendations Home|recs]]
Product Hypothesis: 
> By analyzing the content and actions on the canvas, we can make useful and effective [[Recommendations Home|recommendations]] on the next tool or action 


### Current [[Photoshop]] contextual toolbar
Current Photoshop offers users a contextual toolbar based on the current selected tool. The options and their display order are currently rule based, with no active intelligence. Could this be replaced with a learned system and could that system provide value to a creator?

*When a selection is made, contextually relevant tools are displayed*

*When the selection is canceled, the bar returns to a default state*

| + Could learn from aggregate uncovering potentially new usage patterns<br>+ Options could be personalized over time to the specific users' action patterns | + Simple<br>+ Fast<br>+ Consistant  |
| - Creators may not see the same results, or the same order for every invocation of a tool<br>- Calling this API for every click would be very chatty       | - Static <br>- Potentially limiting |

### Offline learning approach 
Could we track this behavior and train something offline? 

### SDC / [[Photoshop]] value
There are some key product viability questions to answer: 
1. Tools are a much smaller set of options than media in stock, limiting value in contextualizing these options. 
2. Creators tend to be much more conservative than communicators, creating more natural resistance to this kind of feature. 
3. Would a learned approach provide substantial incremental value over the current approach? 
4. Could we actually get [[Photoshop]] to instrument their app and gather the mass of data required to train something effective here? 
	1. Using synthetic data would effectively be replicating the current implementation of rules. Rendering the project moot. 

## AI foundations program Q4 updates

Based on the FY25Q2 official 1-pager and recent program developments, key shifts for Q4:

**Program Evolution Since Q2**:
- **Relevance WS**: USS changes for non-linear High Precision Ranker more complex than anticipated - AB testing pushed to Q4
- Strong momentum on [[Core Affinity Framework]] outperforming GPT-4 mini
- [[NER & SRL|SRL]] V1.1 deployed with baseline accuracy metrics established

**Major Q4 Business Impact Priorities**:
- [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] 4.0 production ready for testing in Recs and [[Artemis]]
- Asset [[Core Affinity Framework|affinity]] base model (Express Unified Search + [[user content|Enterprise content]], Stock video)  
- [[SLM]] production ready with fine-tuning for DC summarization use cases
- [[Intent AI Home|MINT]] for CKG 4.x production usage
- Discovery Hub integration work progressing

**Technical Advancement Highlights**:
- [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] 4.0 M1 in Prod (EN & PT; 13 node types; 3 edge types)
- [[Intent AI Home|MINT]] Multilingual Tier 1 model training and stage deployment
- Multi-modal LLM-based intent inference (PoC)
- [[AdobeOne V2]] throughput improvements for Express, Stock, Lr

**Key Areas for Q4 1-Pager Updates**:
1. **Shift from exploration to production** - emphasize production readiness vs R&D
2. **Capability team integration** - highlight collaboration with Express, Stock, [[Acrobat|DC]], [[Lr Home|Lr]] teams  
3. **Measurable business impact** - include CTR improvements, relevance metrics from live testing
4. **[[Multi-Language 2025|Multi-language]] expansion** - address Stock's CAT and concept translator requirements
5. **High precision search framing** - move beyond generic AI foundation messaging to specific precision/recall improvements
6. **Operational excellence** - highlight 99.99% availability targets and evaluation automation

**Success Metrics to Emphasize**:
- Adoption rates across capability teams
- Model quality documentation and NFRs achievement  
- Self-service Discovery Hub enabling 80% of evaluations
- Ranker foundation model customization agility
