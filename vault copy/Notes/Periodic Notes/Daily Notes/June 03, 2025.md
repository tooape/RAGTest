		- Aperture bucket



- Field matching 
	- https://wiki.corp.adobe.com/display/OZ/Search+Requirements+for+May+Ecosystem+release
		- FNumber is the right field for aperture 
		- focal length is always an INT

	- [[Lr Home|Lr]] web paginates, this is a secondary problem 
- Aggregation buckets 
	- From that one page
- NERs
	- NERs to test
