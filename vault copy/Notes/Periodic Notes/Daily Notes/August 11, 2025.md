## Lightroom Q4 
- Web launch
- Web testing 
- Web GA planning and scope
	- indexing 
- Embeddings tests 

## Lr Low and Null 
- We should be careful in low results situations. Showing results is always preferred but we shouldn't overwrite the better results with the recovered results. 

The most likely low or null use case will be people forgetting a piece of metadata. They type "hawaii 2023" but the vacation they're thinking of was actually in 2022, or "Nikon Taj Mahal" but they actually shot the image they have in mind on a Sony. 


Fallbacks: 
1. Removing filtered NERs
	1. apply them as boosts instead
	2. remove them entirely 
2. (single token) - using embeddings for single token searches if nothing comes back from cat / mint seach
3. Using cat / mint for multi-token search
