# Notes

## Scope notes and definition of done 
- **M2.1:** Extracting [[[[Color]]|[[Colo]]r|[[Color|colors]]]] of a Template to use as query parameters in the stock query for assets 
	- Up to 6 [[Color|colors]] are extracted from the template 
	- These [[Color|colors]] are returned as hex codes, not names
	- Associations are ranked by [[Color]] 
		- Each association should have affinity to one or two of the [[Color|colors]] returned based on the [[Color]] model in MINT
		- Elements within this association are ranked by the given [[Color]]
- **M2.2:** [[semantic disambiguation]] 
	- Given a general term like party, mixer, history, etc we should display on the contextually relevant elements from this
	- This does not mean the actual display name of the association/category to the user must be changed from the [[Canonical Node Name]]
- **M2.3:** Logic for when to update intents  
	- Text weighted higher than image/rendition 
	- Anything user provided should be weighted higher than elements from [[Express]] itself 
	- User query + one element on the canvas is required for initial recs on a start from blank use case
		- If there's no query in the session, 2 elements are required 
- **M2.4:** Non-repeating of near duplicate, or already present associations
	- Data diagram
		- ![[Rec thumbnail generation.png|500x500]]
	- We must be able to throw away or skip associations which are semantically already covered in the result set
	- This should be parameterized as part of our exploration controls
	- [[Evaluation|Eval]]
		- for the top 100 templates, return the top k (3, 5?) associations from both of the top 2 intents
		- Semantically duplicative associations should be present in less than 5% of these template association sets 
	- Milestone also extends to things which are already in the canvas; eg:
		- ![[Screenshot 2024-06-18 at 10.06.40 PM.png|500]]
		- Soda & Fries are the more relevant (or maybe "useful") associations here
- **M2.5:** Multi-Intent Understanding 
	- Go with the definitions in the wiki page 
- **M2.6:** Recency Bias
	- Start from blank 
		- Rise and fall
			- the first 2 - 5 elements will be very important but after this they will taper off more 
	- Start from template 
		- First user text edit is key, we know they will change the place holder data, we must pay attention to what they change. 
		- From there 
- **M2.7:** Relevance Threshold
	- The real questions here are: 
		- When do we feel like we have something new and novel? 
		- When do we feel like adding something new to the list to show the user?

## When to refresh 
The user's goal is to create a nice looking canvas that communicates what they were looking to get across. 
We know users are not professional designers, and may not know what they want, or even what to search for. Likewise, all creatives of any skill level will get stuck, need new ideas, or lack inspiration.
Our goal is to help bridge these gaps. 

> How might we help or guide users to create projects they could not have on their own?

We need to push past showing the user what they already have, or even what they know they want, we're doing more than just saving them a query. 

Use cases: 
1. If the user adds an image of a burger, how do we not show them 75 more burgers, but instead a milkshake and fries?
2. If the user is working on a project and get's stuck, how do we offer them some new ideas to consider?

**problem statement:**
Assuming we're able to reliably re-duplicate semantically similar concepts, what we're really looking to accomplish with re-freshing intent is looking for markers which indicate that a user may have introduced a new Idea into the canvas. 
- New topic or association 
- New [[Color]] 
- new text 
- new type of element 
- User provided content 

**User backtracking**
If they starting working on some direction creatively (eg. using fewer photos and more [[Icons]]/design assets) and then decide they do not like the idea, they will either delete these new elements or use the undo function. 
For undo actions we must be deterministic and consistant enough to be able to get the same intents/associations for the same canvas state.
ie. the [[Recommendations Home|recs]] should revert to whatever they were prior to the action which was just un-done

For deletions, we need to consider the frequency. Deleting an element1 which is a photo, and then deleting an element2 which is a photo from the same association, isn't much signal on what they don't like about their current canvas. But if they delete 2 elements of different types, we should take that as a change in direction. 
We need to think about some action based de-bounce or await.

# Meetings

## [[Ritu Goel|Ritu]] #meetings/1x1 

- Publishing addon as employee beta 
	- testing relevance for top3
	- Using it's feedback and usage as leverage with [[Express]]
- [[Q3 MINT Roadmap]]
	- [x] make a roadmap meeting

Intent prioritization 
1. [[Artemis]]
2. COntextual 
3. [[I2A]]
	1. Unless this is blocking [[Evaluation|eval]]



## [[Kosta Blank|Kosta]] #meetings/1x1 

Spoke to [[Ritu Goel|Ritu]] about the addon thing, trying to position it as an internal release. And we need to be mindful that the AB test is the real goal. 

There will be a [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] roadmap Q3 conversation next week. 

This [[Ravindra Sadaphule|ravindra]] inspiration thing isn't a great idea, and represents a trend of people trying to do too much. Contextualization in [[Express]] is somewhat ambitious already, we need to get the execution right there. 



what if someone likes the templt [[Style Home|style]], but replaces all text

weight text differently


## Mid year Q2 2024 check in 

**Doing well** 
I appreciate the trust and communication we have. I feel like I get good feedback about things im doing well, where I need to pay more attention or dive in, etc. But I also feel like I have ownership or autonomy in my areas and am not micro managed over every minutiae. 

**Could do better** 
I feel like the weekly staff meetings could be more useful. Passdowns are passdowns obviously but for things like internal demos or conversations, etc. That time we were all in townsend last month and had the bigger chat about [[Express]] relationship/working pattern was really great.

8 or 9 [[Firefly|GenAI]] assets
- [[Style Home|style]] generation 
- what are the objects for some [[Style Home|style]] or prompt 
	- assisted prompts
	- [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] [[B2B]]
		- what are the [[marketing]] associations 


ping jusna (new PgM)


how do we bring in other data, or other systems if we dont feel like it needs to be in the graph?
[[Audio|Music]] recs are separate from the graph
- not every association is going to be us (video -> [[Audio]])
- part of contextual but not the graph?

Understanding of the graph is generalized 
- B2C birthday emails 
	- these are going to be different templates than someone sending a card to their grandma
	- EDU, [[B2B]], etc 
- [[Personalization Home|Personalization]] will be owned by SDC

Vision for other CC apps
