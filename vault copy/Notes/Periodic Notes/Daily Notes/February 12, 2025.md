## Birgit chat about bablescape #meetings 
- https://[[CKG 4.0|babelscape]].com/solution/knowledge-graphs


**My understanding**
The primary concern in the [[Babelscape_Data License Agreement for WordAtlas_CW 2575710_04-15-20.pdf|agreement]] seems to be us providing users easy methods to scrape or re-assemble their data. Usage of this system for training or building our own models, technology, dictionaries, etc across the supported languages seems to be allowed?

**Training & Evaluation**
1. Using the [[Intent AI Home|knowledge graph]], entity taxonomy, and entity ontology in [[CKG 4.0|babelscape]] as part of the training of our own [[Intent AI Home|knowledge graph]] ([[Intent AI Home|CKG]])
	1. Individual features: 
		1. Ontology
		2. Taxonomy and hierarchy structure
		3. Expansion of concepts/entities
2. Using the concept graph in [[CKG 4.0|babelscape]] as a "golden truth" for larger scale evaluations. 
3. Using Bablescape as a way to link concepts across languages 
	1. Fr: "Pomme" -> En: "Apple" 
4. Using the synonyms, hyponyms, hypernyms in [[CKG 4.0|babelscape]] to train links, and hierarchy in our [[Intent AI Home|CKG]]

**Using their graph outright**
- Using bablescape as an outright replacement of [[Intent AI Home|CKG]], using our models to take a canvas and link directly to bablescape.

pie in the sky is a user bringing a pintrest baord of shit and getting some 90% of the way there stuff that they love. What is their "discoveryign" googie arch moment? what is there "oh THATs Japandi". 

## template style eval
comment 
a lot of the [[Style Home|style]] of these is driven off of place holder images/assets which the user would quickly change.
