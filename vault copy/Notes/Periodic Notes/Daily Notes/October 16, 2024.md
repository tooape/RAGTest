## Video intent understanding #meetings


Lisa boghosian 

"timeline" is jsut anything with a timeline, could be a slideshow of still images 

Suggestions will change over the course of the video, scene over scene. 
Timing of events in the timeline, [[Brian Eriksson|brian]]'s dog moment, pointing, name drops, etc. 

How do we get the word "vibes" and interpret this as "sparkle icon"

2 - 3 min

just knowing if voice is in a video or if it's just recorded/effects/etc

Content understanding: 
- What are people throwing at us
- 

## questions 

- [[Recommendations Home|Contextual recs]] seems to be the big use case?
- Timeline?
- Length of video?
- [[Style Home|Style]]?
- [[Audio]] [[Recommendations Home|recs]]?



## [[Brian Eriksson|Brian]] #meetings/1x1 

[[Artemis]] is mostly a preview of possible edits or directions
"im feeling lucky button"

if design AI is an area of investment, how do we do an [[Evaluation|eval]] which convinces [[Amanda Fetterly|Amanda]] we know what's up. How do we become a valid voice in the space.
