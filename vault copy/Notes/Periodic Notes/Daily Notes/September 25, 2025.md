Hi all, 

In the Q4 review a few questions about CKG and MINT came up and I wanted to clarify a few: 
1. Are we still working on or contributing to CKG3.5? → No, CKG 3.5 can be considered KTLO. 
2. How will we start use case testing CKG4 and realizing value? → We'll start with DC contextual recommendations. Chiefly because this is a text heavy use case, with little multi-modal requirement. And because it gives us a smaller set of about ~20k concepts of concern. This allows us to narrow the scope of our quality investigations in CKG4. 
3. Is MINTv2 tied to CKG3.4 → No, MINTv2 is compatible with CKG4. 
4. How will we streamline additions and modifications to CKG4, as needs arise? → We currently have tooling for adding to and changing the graph. These tools will be hardened and further developed to allow fast changes by intent, and use case teams going forward. 


We know there's other questions here about inference developments, we'll discuss these more in the Monday check in. We will also be working on a more detailed plan to spell out exactly what the path forward is here in Q4 which we'll look to share with this group by end of next week. 

Have a great weekend!
