## Documentation requirements 

### Dev Guide
> goal: create a document for engineers in non-SDC teams to: 
> 1. Quickly get recommendations working in a POC state to see results. 
> 2. Understand best practices and implementation patterns to follow in setting up recs for this POC

1. **Structure and Organization**
    - progression from basic to advanced concepts
    - Create a clear table of contents with numbered sections
    - Include a "Quick Start" section that gets a team who is interested in testing out contextual recs set up within 15 minutes
2. **API Reference**
    - Document each endpoint with consistent formatting including:
        - Endpoint URL and method
        - Request parameters with types, constraints, and examples
        - Response format with example payloads
        - Error codes and handling
    -  Auth details
    - Provide rate limiting information  
3. **Code Examples and best practices**
    - Include working code examples 
    - Provide complete integration examples for existing use cases (Contextual recs and Artemis)
4. **Technical Implementation Patterns**
    - Document recommended patterns for different use cases:
        - Real-time query processing
        - Batch processing for content
        - Multi-language support implementation
        - [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] integration patterns (diversity, association depth, etc)
    - Include performance considerations and optimization techniques
5. **Troubleshooting and Support**
    - Include common errors and solutions
    - Document known limitations and workarounds
    - Include performance benchmarks and SLAs

### User Guide
> goal: create a document for PM and Eng Managers in non-SDC teams to quickly look through and get enough of a sense of our capabilities to form their own ideas about how recommendations might work in their product area. This is meant to serve as a pass-along guide in conjunction with some demo or intro meeting we would have with them. 

- **Capability Overview / Intro section**
    - Create a clear, non-technical summary of what recs can do
        - Link to the contextual recs overview deck
    - Explain key concepts with visual diagrams
        - multi-modality
        - word count (don't say *"token"*)
        - intent understanding
        - etc.
    - Provide a capabilities matrix showing what's available across languages 
    - Include a glossary of terms accessible to non-technical users
        - incl. "token" here, but continue to say "words" in the actual guide content 
- **Business Value and Use Cases**
    - Document specific business problems solved by each capability
    - Include data/results from existing implementations in AX 
        - Provide metrics showing impact (e.g., improved search relevance, higher CTR)
- **Implementation Planning**
    - Block diagram of how to get recs going in some arbitrary use case 
        - Canvas rendition, text, video -> USS -> Stock -> return to client  
- **Visual Examples and Demonstrations**
    - Incl contextual recs overview deck
    - artemis demo
    - Ps demo
    - [[Recommendations Home|PDF]] demo
    - others?
- **Roadmap and Evolution**
    - Styles
    - Multi-lang
    - Personalization
