## Ian's staff #meetings 

[[Intent AI Home|MINT]] demo

Big notes: 
1. FY25 consideration: if user has a brand set up, can we incorporate that into the [[Recommendations Home|contextual recs]] [[Style Home|style]] and/or [[Style Home|color]] recommendations? [@rsklar](https://adobesearch.slack.com/team/U01TXKDJY1Z)
2. FY25 consideration: esp. if we don’t have assets that we feel are strong stylistic or [[Style Home|color]] matches, can we use “style match” ([[Firefly]]) within Express --> generate [[Recommendations Home|contextual recs]] accordingly? [@ggoodman](https://adobesearch.slack.com/team/U023R0DCJHX) great idea for design assets in particular.
### Quotes 
**Tal Shoer:** 
> I was thinking around, for example, the style clustering. If that's done, it would be incredibly useful to store it centrally as additional meta data to inform future content [[Recommendations Home|recommendations]]. If not in the plan, might be an interesting opportunity!

Ari Fuchs: "
> and how does this relate to the PLG architecture that's collecting user profile and user intent

Tal:
> I had discussed that there feels like there's an opportunity merge the best of both worlds down the line, but definitely warrants a broader discussion. We're working through clustering content based on user signals. Together, we'd have user preferences/history with hyper-contextual canvas knowledge.

**Chloe McConnell**
> How can these [[Recommendations Home|contextual recommendations]] take the users' brand into account? (style, colors...)

**George Goodman**
> I think its important for us to acknowledge when we simply don't have 'good enough' contextual assets and then turn to generation with reference images to make that match still happen.
