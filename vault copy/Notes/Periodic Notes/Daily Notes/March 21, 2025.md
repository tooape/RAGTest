## [[Intent AI Home|SLM]] Use cases

### [[Recommendations Home|Recommendations]]
**Exploration: Canvas Inner text**
Some canvases have quite a bit of text, which can lead to [[Intent AI Home|MINT]] returning many intents of varying quality. Likewise, some templates will have multiple canonical intents pertaining to different sections of the page. For instance consider a social post advertising a sale on running shoes. You'd likely expect an intent related to sale or ecommerce, and one related to sports or running. However today [[Intent AI Home|MINT]] will most often over index one intent and the other will be pushed outside the top 10 results. This creates 2 issues we'll explore solving with [[Intent AI Home|SLM]]: 

1. Reducing the number of semantic duplicates in [[Recommendations Home|contextual recommendations]]
2. Capturing a broader range of canonical intents and associations within the top 10 results
