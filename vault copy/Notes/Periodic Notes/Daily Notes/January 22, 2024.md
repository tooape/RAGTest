User starsts with an imae they took in soco, but they look at it and thing "huh, the sun and my friend's wacky cowboy hat look cool in person but this photo sucks"

They should be able to come to "adobe" with this issue, we're thecreativity company. 
They should be able to bring the photo into express and we can take that and say "ok, it's a still image not a video, etc... so we're looking at the imaging apps, and it probably dosn't need to be a wild composite image, it just needs touching up, so we're looking at image editing. Instantiate the Lr tools, add an S curve, and shift the blues/greens."
 this is what express should be.
