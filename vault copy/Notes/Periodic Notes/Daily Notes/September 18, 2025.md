**Photo [[Style Home|style]] annotations**
[[top_styles_list_short_with_descriptions Ryan edit.json]]
I've added quite a bit of photo specific vernacular, including specific film stock examples, industry conventions, and kelvin values of white balance. It's been my experience that LLMs have excellent pre-training on these terms. 

Other changes:
- Get rid of "digital noise"
	- Grain is synonymous with "noise" here. 
- simplified grain to just High, md, low 
	- Rough vs smooth was too photo nerd-y and likely causing confusion. 

**Question:**
- Are the examples introducing semantic and scene content noise?
