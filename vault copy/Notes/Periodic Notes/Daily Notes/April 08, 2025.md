## Node types in [[CKG 4.0|ckg4.0]]

Use Cases
1. Disambiguate "crop" the tool from "crop" tops
2. Evolve with use cases which SDC prioritizes
	1. DMe taxonomy 
3. 


Why is a node valuable at all? 
1. It seperates the type of information contained in a node, from it's taxonomy 
2. It lets a user request only the kinds of information it wants to use.
3. It makes the graph more communicable. 
4. Gives context and organization to the returned information

When are these things actual advantages? 
1. When a use case would like to treat them differently 
	1. People, topics, Design attributes, content types
2. When broad context needs to be established 
	1. What might a user want to do with this input?
	2. Are there people in the MM input which would require more sensitive treatment?
	3. What might the user want next? 
		1. Tools, topics, content by type or [[Style Home|style]]
3. When working on the graph
	1. Talking about where teams should look for different information
