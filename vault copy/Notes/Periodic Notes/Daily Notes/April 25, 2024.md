## [[Ritu Goel|Ritu]] #meetings/1x1 

Evals for contextual 

- [x] Meeting with [[Amanda Fetterly|amanda]] to demo contextual, and discuss how to break down color understanding 
	- Getting design bought in may be a challenge, they own the editor panel. Need to make them feel like co-owner. 
		- "Now that we understand intent, how do we rank XYZ" should get discussed with them

Also need to get EDU bought in. 

Getting Justin/Vic bought in on a one week A/B test. What are their concerns?

Get PLG to hard code some templates with what our recs would be offline. And getting the stats back.
