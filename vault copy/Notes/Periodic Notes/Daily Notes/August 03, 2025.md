	- Prompt the agent to use it's thinking well 
	- interleaved tools calls 
- Agents operate in a loop
	- "keep searching until you..." will cause it to just spin until it caps out the context window
	- "if you don't find the perfect source, that's ok, move on to XYZ"

	- Compaction 
	- Writing memory to an External ≤
	- Subagents 
		- delegating an agent as a sub agent that will compress their output to the lead agent
