Unraid is really great. I was growing quite frustrated using Qnap/QTS and decided to install unraid and give it a go. It's no more complex or esoteric as QTS to use, the parity methodology is so much better, more than fast enough for my needs (just a media server)... My girlfriend and I got tailscale running and now we're questioning our google Cloud subscription all together. I really wasn't expecting this to be a good or as (relatively) easy as it was. Shouts out, this product rules.
