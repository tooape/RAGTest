1. [[Recommendations Home|unified search]] 
2. search assets sub agent 

Focus is on top1, then top3 as a nice to have. 

## Ritu staff #meetings 

- **Language AI**: I’m a bit confused on the ownership model. Francois is leading LangAI, and I’m supporting as it pertains to intent / [[Intent AI Home]]? Or Francois is just providing some early guidance while I get up to speed?
	- Francois drives all pure language req, im still on intent 
- **Template MLT [[Recommendations Home|Recs]]:** You’d previously mentioned you considered this search, but this morning I think it got brought up as a recommender. Is that something I need to jump in on or leave it to Andrei?
	- Things where a template is provided is [[RAG]] 
	- Feeds are [[Recommendations Home|recs]] 
- **Tech leadership:** [[Intent AI Home|MINT]] & [[Intent AI Home]] are still under Ravindra, but [[Recommendations Home|recs]] as a capability is Brian, correct?
