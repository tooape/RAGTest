Hi 

I'm from the Search, Discovery, and Content AI team. We're building a recommender feature which will analyze the contents of the users canvas

A question has come up around being able to show [[Recommendations Home|recommendations]] related to the names of websites or apps. I know some names like "instagram" and "linkedin" already appear in the product UI. Does that mean we're ok to use these names in other parts of express? Full list of the websites in question below: 


```
facebook
linkedin
snapchat
facebook_post
youtube_banner
instagram
twitter_banner
twitch

bandit is an extension of [[Personalization Home|personalization]] 
> I search cat and you search cat and we get different cats

We'll need to build the Mirai components required to power this, we'll need the session management that Mirai offers. 

We shouldn't call it bandit, we can use thompson sampling or reinforcement learning
