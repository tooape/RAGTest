# Notes

- [x] Roadmap session with the team:
	- Run through [the full deck](https://new.express.adobe.com/publishedV2/urn:aaid:sc:VA6C2:60221814-ca06-4643-98c8-45aee7c955f0?promoid=Y69SGM5H&mv=other)
	- Quickly run through search, and browse
	- Really hit [[Recommendations Home|recs]] 
	- Add a tech roadmap section for ILU and [[Intent AI Home|MINT]]

For style we're always going to have a ranking problem as it relates to the index. How many 3D rendered vampires can we have? What's the next closest style?
