## Lr low and null recovery
imo the most likely null use case will be people forgetting a piece of metadata. They type "hawaii 2023" but the vacation they're thinking of was actually in 2022, or "Nikon Taj Mahal" but they actually shot the image they have in mind on a Sony.For that case I think the best recovery would be to remove any NER filtering and see if there's results then.For a low results situation I think we should tread fairly lightly, there's a lot of scenarios where a user would want just a handful of images and nothing more, so trying to recover too aggressively might degrade results.The only exception to that is single token searches where the token **_isn't_**:

- Filename
- An excact NER match on something like a date or a camera brand
- A CAT or MINT tag


In which case we should probably fall back to just running it as an embedding search.

## Photostyles #meetings/1x1 

Getting some triples
- these two photos are similar, this one isnt
- Dimensions which are not [[Style Home|style]]

## Cherag #meetings/1x1 

**ILUP features for lr**
retraining ML NERs would be 3 weeks 


- Spellcheck 
	- Could be implemented however we want 
	- Need to understand the cases and the % of queries which are misspelled
- Content in the tech deck


## Ayush #meetings/1x1 


Intern demo: 
- christian's MSLM demo would be the input to MINT model which grounds in the graph 

[MSLM Demo](https://pluto-prod-christianf-mslm-demo-1-0-7860.colligo.dev/)

Write up some use cases where this would be useful
- in prod today on 3.5.9
- tomorrow on 4.0
