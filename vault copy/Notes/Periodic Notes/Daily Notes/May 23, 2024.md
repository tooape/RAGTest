## [[Ritu Goel|Ritu]] #meetings/1x1 

We're positioning [[Recommendations Home]] as a creative assistant thing. 
Collaborating with research in [[Express]] 


### [[Recommendations Home|Contextual Editor]] 
- [x] Get a dump of the manually curated collections 
Showing the more abstract concepts first and then letting the user drill down. 
- Action sports > skateboarding 

How might we show the collections within the curated genres in our contextualization. 

### [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] Q3 24
Demo idea: 
Search + gen , long prompt scenario. Token parsing from the prompt ([[Color]], subject, etc)
1. Push them to add some background if we didn't find one 
2. Show the relevant backgrounds as a carousel of "backgrounds for your generation" while the generation is rendering 

Using the thematic content to help suggest [[Style Home|style]]. If the poster is an evening party at the beach why would we show images of sunny beaches. 

- [x] Could we have an intern work on the semantic vs [[Style Home|style]] embedding space ([Projects list](https://wiki.corp.adobe.com/display/adobesearch/SDC+Intern+Projects+2024))
