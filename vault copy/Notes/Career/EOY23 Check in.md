e## **How did you deliver against your individual business goals this year?** _Focus on the top 3 most impactful initiatives or outcomes — you do not need to capture everything you did_
### Commerce 
- [[iMerch]] Search & Browse, Enterprise 
	- I bought multiple teams together to execute on a multi year vision to create the two biggest features in Commerce last year from ideation. 
	- This delivered on a major strategic gap in Commerce, and a promise we'd been making to users for years. 
	- Won deals with users in our ICP including [[Toyota]] and [[Maidenform|Hanes]]  
		- [[Toyota]] delivered >3x their sales goal using our merchandising services 
### SDC
- Becoming embedded in the [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] team and planning process 
	- A lot of my feedback in the [[SDC Speed Feedback Fall 2023]] mentioned how quickly i've gotten up on [[Intent AI Home|CKG]]
	- Null/low & [[Artemis]] 
	- Integrating into the team 
		- [[Tracy King|Tracy]] / [[Jayant Kumar|Jayant]] 
		- Making effort 
- Driving influence over [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] roadmap
	- Ramping up on Evals and the product technicals 
	- DevEx 

## **How did you not deliver as intended against your individual business goals this year?** _Own the outcome and highlight what you learned and plan to do differently._

Early on i over rotated on the program being the big thing to get to terms with. I spent a lot of time thinking about how to play into that system because I was worried we'd never have the cross team alignment needed to ship anything if I didn't, but I went to far and spun my wheels for some days/weeks when I could've spent that time on the tech or on the roadmap. 

Likewise I went to far on vision/direction setting. I spent a lot of time trying to police every conversation and keep all the engineers focused. Engineers will always be exploratory, I can define and get buy in on certain things being very important and setting a strategy, but beyond that I have to let the engineers carry that message for themselves and make their own decisions. I spent too much time here for little gain, and let some areas (like the evaluations) slip, assuming that the engineers and the wealth of data we had would have an answer already. This proved not to be the case, and we ultimately lost time on it. 

- [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] still chaotic 
	- [[Evaluation]] still off base
		- too related to graph level [[Evaluation]] of query coverage
		- Too based on GPT scoring 
	- Focus for 2024 still needs alignment 
- Plan to do differently 
	- Solidify and communicate pie in the sky vision
	- Get more practically hands on 
		- Ingestion / [[Evaluation|Eval]] 
		- DevEx / Integration

[[Ritu Goel|Ritu]] comments: 
- Interaction and comms with [[People/Andrei Stefan|Andrei]] 
	- I go to him with new tech, he comes to me with express direction 
	- understanding how the content intel, the user intel, and the implementation come together

## **What is a win outside of your business goals that you want to celebrate from this year and why?** _This could be progress against your professional development goals, impact on an employee network, or, if you are a manager, how you improved your team’s experience._
