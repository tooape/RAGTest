B2B 


Customers are usually small retail stores 
- sells groceries 
- farmers

A sku might be popular in one vs the other 


Each region is a customer group
- logged in user
- Pricing changes but SKUs do not 

this is managed by another group and they'll have their own merch strats between each other 

inventory 

Recs works well for them 

how many groups do they have?
- 10s of customer groups 
- 100s if multiple countries 

customer groups are defined in ERPs
- looking into syncing this to commerce
