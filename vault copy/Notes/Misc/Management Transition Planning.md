# Management Transition Planning
---

## Context & Philosophy

**[[Brian Eriksson|Brian]]'s insight**: Promotions and movements into management are more **organizationally need-driven than personal accomplishment-driven**. This reframes career growth - it's not about "earning" the next level through individual achievement, but about filling a genuine structural gap.

**Key insight**: You need to be capable *and* organizational space needs to exist. The accomplishment narrative is incomplete without the structural component.

**Dad's framing**: "The role of management is to get extraordinary results from an ordinary roster."

## The Fundamental Shift

**From**: Your personal output and technical contributions  
**To**: Aggregate output of your team's collective work

This is the hardest transition - accepting you can't be the hero IC anymore.

## The Opportunity

### Why Now

[[Ritu Goel|Ritu]]'s org needs structure due to breadth of current in-flight work:
- Can help ease manager load, let her focus on top-line strategy
- **[[Brian Eriksson|Brian]]'s explicit framing**: "Ritu needs someone she can trust"
- This is about trust, judgment, and context - not just technical delivery

### Timeline

- **[[Vipul Dalal|Vipul]] staff meeting**: End of November 2025
- Would need [[Ritu Goel|Ritu]] to make the pitch to [[Vipul Dalal|Vipul]], [[Ravindra Sadaphule|Ravindra]], and leadership
- Quick move (just bumped L40→L50 in July), but technically lateral so not a blocker

### Who Would I Manage

**Francois** and **Eshan** ([[Brian Eriksson|Brian]]'s recommendation)

**Francois's portfolio** (AI Foundations focus):
- [[Evaluation|Evals]]
- Relevance workstream  
- Language AI

**Eshan's portfolio** (Product/integration focus):
- EDU
- Autocomplete
- Discovery Guidance

**Combined org scope**:
- Intent & Language
- [[Recommendations Home|Recs]]
- Discovery Guidance
- Autocomplete
- [[Evaluation|Evals]] & relevance

*(Might give [[Intent AI Home|intent]] to Rhut, since he's already focused on agent and assistant work)*

### The Narrative

**"Ritu's org needs it and it makes enough sense"** - not perfect org design, but urgent need + qualified person + sufficient coherence.

**Coherence thread**: AI/ML intelligence capabilities across the stack
- Francois builds foundational models and eval frameworks
- Eshan applies intelligence to user experiences
- Both work on AI-powered capabilities (models vs. applications)

**Why this works**:
- ✅ Common reporting line (both already report to [[Ritu Goel|Ritu]])
- ✅ AI/ML domain expertise applies to both
- ✅ Already embedded in the context ([[Intent AI Home|Intent]], [[Recommendations Home|Recs]], [[Query Understanding|QU]])
- ✅ Organizational load is real (Ritu's span unsustainable)
- ✅ Trust factor ([[Brian Eriksson|Brian]]'s explicit endorsement)
- ✅ No external hire ramp time needed

**What it's NOT**:
- ❌ Perfectly themed McKinsey org chart
- ❌ Natural career progression everyone saw coming

### The Pitch Elements

1. **Organizational need is real**: [[Ritu Goel|Ritu]]'s span too broad, needs structure
2. **Trust/judgment**: [[Brian Eriksson|Brian]]'s "Ritu needs someone she can trust" framing - this is about handling ambiguity, discretion, alignment
3. **Delivery proof point**: [[Lr Home|Lr]] semantic search shipped this year (Brian called this out as big win)
4. **Cross-functional credibility**: [[CKG 4.0]] infrastructure work with [[Subhajit]] (potential positive vote with [[Ravindra Sadaphule|Ravindra]])
5. **Context preservation**: Already deep in these programs - no 6+ month ramp

### Key Relationships & Votes

- **[[Brian Eriksson|Brian]]**: Explicit endorsement, cited [[Lr Home|Lr]] semantic search delivery
- **[[Subhajit]]**: Recent collaboration on graph work (merging offshoots, contributor flows, validation frameworks) - could influence [[Ravindra Sadaphule|Ravindra]]'s vote
- Need approval from: [[Vipul Dalal|Vipul]], [[Ravindra Sadaphule|Ravindra]], leadership team

## Preparation Strategy

### What You Lose (The Emotional Shift Nobody Talks About)

You're about to lose:
- ❌ The dopamine hit of shipping something yourself
- ❌ Clear metrics of personal achievement
- ❌ The "I know I did good work today" feeling

You gain:
- ✅ Ambiguity about whether you're doing well (team success is visible, your contribution is invisible)
- ✅ Credit going to your team (as it should)
- ✅ Watching people struggle when you could solve it in 10 minutes (and having to let them)

**Reality check**: The first 6 months will feel like you're doing nothing, even when you're doing it right.

### Likely Failure Modes

Common first-time manager traps to watch for:

1. **Doing instead of enabling**: Jumping in to fix things yourself because it's faster
   - *Your likely failure mode* - you're a strong IC

2. **Avoiding hard conversations**: Letting small issues compound because feedback is uncomfortable
   - Watch for: [[Radical Candor - Kim Scott|Ruinous Empathy]]

3. **Optimizing for being liked**: Making decisions to avoid conflict instead of what's right

4. **Forgetting you're now "management"**: ICs will read your casual comments as directives

### Pre-Reads (Ordered by Priority)

1. **[[The Manager's Path - Camille Fournier]]**
   - Best tactical guide for first-time managers
   - Focus: "How do I run a 1:1" practical guidance
   - Even though it's for eng managers, frameworks apply directly to PM

2. **[[Radical Candor - Kim Scott]]**  
   - Feedback framework: Care Personally + Challenge Directly
   - Critical: Avoid Ruinous Empathy (most common failure mode)
   - Take "radical" part with grain of salt in corporate environments

3. **[[High Output Management - Andy Grove]]**
   - Old (1983) but gold - very practical
   - Manager's output = team's output (not your personal work)
   - High leverage activities: training, removing blockers, OKRs
   - Introduces Task-Relevant Maturity concept

### Concrete Skills to Practice Now

#### 1:1s
- **Not status updates** (waste of time)
- Ask: "What's the most important thing we should talk about?" and actually discuss that
- End with: "What do you need from me?" (then deliver)
- Let them set the agenda - it's their meeting

#### Feedback
- Practice giving real-time feedback NOW, before you're their manager
- Formula: "When you did X, the impact was Y, here's why that matters"
- Both positive and constructive - most new managers only give positive
- Avoid [[Radical Candor - Kim Scott|Ruinous Empathy]]: don't stay silent to protect feelings

#### Priority Conflicts
- Two projects, one person, both "urgent" - what's your framework?
- Practice saying no on behalf of your team (hard when you're used to saying yes)

#### Delegation
- When someone asks you a question, resist answering directly
- Instead: "Here's how I'd think about it... now you try"
- Give away work you're good at (this will hurt, but it's the skill you need most)

### Pre-Transition Actions (Next 2-3 Weeks)

**1. Shadow current managers you respect**
- Ask [[Brian Eriksson|Brian]] or [[Ritu Goel|Ritu]] if you can sit in on their 1:1s (with IC permission)
- Watch how they give feedback, handle priority conflicts, navigate ambiguity
- Notice what they DON'T do (resist urge to solve every problem themselves)

**2. Build mental models**
Talk to Francois and Eshan informally before any transition:
- What blockers do they hit repeatedly?
- Where do they need air cover vs. autonomy?
- What decisions take them too long because they lack context you have?
- What work are they doing that shouldn't be their job?

This primes you to think: "What systems/context/decisions would unlock them?" vs. "What tasks should I do?"

**3. Identify your failure modes**
- Most likely: Doing instead of enabling (you're a strong IC)
- Second likely: [[Radical Candor - Kim Scott|Ruinous Empathy]] (avoiding hard conversations)
- Plan mitigation strategies

## Transition Timeline & Milestones

### Before Transition (November - Decision Point)

**Activities**:
- [ ] Shadow managers ([[Brian Eriksson|Brian]] or [[Ritu Goel|Ritu]]'s 1:1s)
- [ ] Read [[The Manager's Path - Camille Fournier]]
- [ ] Read [[Radical Candor - Kim Scott]]
- [ ] Informal conversations with Francois/Eshan about current blockers
- [ ] Identify personal failure modes and mitigation strategies

**Deliverable**: Clear understanding of what you're signing up for

### First 30 Days (Learning Mode)

**Primary goal**: Understand the current state, don't change anything yet

**Activities**:
- [ ] 1:1s with each person - learn their goals, blockers, working styles
- [ ] Map dependencies - who needs what from whom?
- [ ] Understand task-relevant maturity (TRM) per person per area
- [ ] Establish 1:1 cadence and norms (let them set agendas)
- [ ] Observe team dynamics and cross-functional relationships

**Resist the urge**: Don't try to "add value" immediately by changing things

**Key questions to answer**:
- What are the systemic blockers? (Not one-off issues)
- Where do people lack context vs. capability?
- What decisions are bottlenecked waiting for [[Ritu Goel|Ritu]]?
- What's the "production process" for each workstream?

**Deliverable**: Written assessment of current state (for yourself, not necessarily to share)

### First 90 Days (Initial Impact)

**Primary goal**: Demonstrate you can enable team output and make hard calls

**Activities**:
- [ ] Clear one major blocker per person (high leverage wins)
- [ ] Make one unpopular prioritization decision (test your tolerance for conflict)
- [ ] Run effective 1:1s with consistent cadence
- [ ] Give direct feedback (both positive and constructive) to each person
- [ ] Identify one systemic process improvement opportunity

**Success metrics**:
- Francois and Eshan report feeling unblocked on at least one major thing
- You've practiced saying "no" to something
- You've given hard feedback without defaulting to [[Radical Candor - Kim Scott|Ruinous Empathy]]
- [[Ritu Goel|Ritu]] feels her load has decreased

**Deliverable**: First 90-day retrospective - what's working, what needs adjustment

### First 6 Months (Rhythm Established)

**Primary goal**: Establish sustainable patterns, prove this org structure works

**Activities**:
- [ ] Regular 1:1 cadence is working (they're bringing real issues, not just status)
- [ ] Feedback loops functioning (giving + receiving continuous feedback)
- [ ] OKRs established for team (3-5 max, per [[High Output Management - Andy Grove]])
- [ ] At least one training session delivered to team (high leverage activity)
- [ ] Clear escalation paths and decision rights established

**Warning signs to watch for**:
- You're doing IC work because it's "faster" (means you're not delegating)
- You avoid giving hard feedback (defaulting to [[Radical Candor - Kim Scott|Ruinous Empathy]])
- Team members surprised by your priorities (means communication gaps)
- You feel busy but team output hasn't increased (low leverage activities)

**Success looks like**:
- Team shipping more/better with less [[Ritu Goel|Ritu]] involvement
- Francois and Eshan making decisions you would have made (they have the context now)
- You spending time on high-leverage activities: training, removing systemic blockers, strategic planning
- [[Vipul Dalal|Vipul]]/[[Ravindra Sadaphule|Ravindra]] seeing this as successful org structure

## High Leverage Activities (Per Andy Grove)

**Focus your time on**:
1. **Training** - Highest leverage activity (12 hours prep → 200 hours increased output if 10 people × 1% improvement)
2. **Removing systemic blockers** - Fix the problem once for everyone
3. **1:1s focused on potential problems** - Early warning system
4. **Strategic planning** - Forces thinking through trade-offs, creates shared understanding

**Low leverage activities to avoid**:
- ❌ Doing IC work yourself (no matter how much faster you'd be)
- ❌ Status update meetings (use async communication)
- ❌ Firefighting individual issues (unless systemic)
- ❌ Being in every meeting (trust your team)

**Before doing anything, ask**: "Is this high leverage?" If not, delegate or skip.

## Management Concepts to Master

### Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)

From [[High Output Management - Andy Grove]]:
- Someone's competence is **task-specific**, not universal
- Expert IC → Novice manager
- High TRM in one area → Low TRM when promoted/shifted

**Application**:
- Don't assume Francois/Eshan have high TRM everywhere
- Assess TRM per task: Where do they need direction? Where do they need autonomy?
- Your management style should match their TRM on specific tasks

### Manager's Output Formula

From [[High Output Management - Andy Grove]]:

```
Manager's Output = Output of their organization + Output of neighboring organizations under their influence
```

**Implications**:
- Your job is NOT your personal output
- Success = enabling team's collective output
- Influence extends beyond direct reports (cross-functional impact)

### The Four Quadrants

From [[Radical Candor - Kim Scott]]:

**Goal**: Care Personally + Challenge Directly = [[Radical Candor - Kim Scott|Radical Candor]]

**Watch for**: Ruinous Empathy (care without challenge)
- Most common failure mode for new managers
- Staying silent to avoid hurting feelings
- "Nice" but not kind - prevents growth

## Open Questions to Resolve

1. **IC work balance**: What % IC work is appropriate during transition? Zero? 20%? (Discuss with [[Ritu Goel|Ritu]])

2. **Francois vs. Eshan coverage**: Are their working styles very different? Will they need different management approaches?

3. **[[Intent AI Home|Intent]] handoff to Rhut**: If that happens, what's the transition plan?

4. **Decision rights**: What decisions can you make vs. need [[Ritu Goel|Ritu]]'s approval? (Need clarity upfront)

5. **Budget/headcount authority**: Will you have hiring authority? Budget control?

6. **Evaluation criteria**: How will [[Vipul Dalal|Vipul]]/[[Ravindra Sadaphule|Ravindra]] measure if this org structure is working?
