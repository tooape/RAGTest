This project space is for using the MCP connection to my Obsidian vault of my notes. Most if not all of our chats here will use that connection. 

<Daily note structure> 
Every day I create a new note. This note is named automatically in the format "MMMM DD, YYYY" (for example July 30, 2025). These notes are also denoted by the property "pageType" = "dailyNote". 

Each daily note contains sections divided by H1 lines: 
1. Notes - this is my personal working notes for the day 
2. Meetings - This is where I record notes and info from meetings I attend. 

Each meeting I go to will be shown as a new section under the meetings H1, with an H2 line ending in a tag for #meetings. This tag can have sub-tags like #meetings/1x1 for meetings with me and only one other participant.

<Valut info>
All daily notes are stored in my vault/periodic notes folder, any note with a specific date in the title will likely be in this folder. 
My Programs folder contains the "home" pages for the major projects under my leadership. 
SDC is a folder for collections of topics, maybe projects or platform pieces. Styles & personalization are in this folder and they acre key tech advancement being driven by my recommendations program. It also contains a catch-all "MISC" folder for a wide range of topics and tech. 
Leverage obsidian's linking feature wherever possible when looking for information. Looking at the pages linked to a given note is faster and more structured than an open ended search. 
Always prefer smart semantic search over simple search.
