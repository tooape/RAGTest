## Intro
- Tell me about your experience in search & AI? 
- Do you have much person experience with Adobe Products? 

## Rag Eval Scenario 
Adobe is launching 'Creative Mentor' - a Retrieval Augmented Generation ([[RAG]]) powered assistant that answers complex creative questions and helps users in Creative Cloud apps. It draws on Adobe's knowledge base of tutorials, best practices, creative guidelines, as well as Adobe owned content like Adobe Stock photos and Express elements, as well as user content. The system needs to handle queries like 'How do I create a vintage poster aesthetic in Photoshop?', 'help me create a split tone look in Lightroom' or 'What are current logo design trends for startups?'.

Creative Mentor is nearing it's first end-to-end functional test with systems like document chunking, embedding search models, and LLM integrations all coming together. With this milestone in sight, you need to design an evaluation and launch strategy:

Tasks:
1. Design the evaluation strategy to determine if Creative Mentor's relevance is good enough to launch.
2. Outline an ethics and safety plan to check the system for potentially harmful or offensive content.
3. Define the A/B testing plan you will use to validate Creative Mentor's against the current lexical search experience. 

### Influence
Several different engineering teams from things like Intent Understanding, Semantic search, applied research, and Ops teams have all come together to  build this out. But let's say some of the internal evaluations come back below expectations, and you need one of these partner teams to spend more time on another iteration of their models. 

But they're pushing back, saying they have other priorities and things they need to work on for other projects, and they they have major deliverables. 

How do you work with this team to get the creative mentor's performance completed up to your benchmark?

## Vision 
Stepping outside of this rag scenario... 

1. There's an ongoing debate about whether AI enhances or threatens human creativity. What's your personal take on this, and how do you see Adobe's role in shaping that future?
2. Where do you think we'll be in 10 years when it comes to how people create? Not just the tools, but the entire creative process and what it means to be creative or explore ideas visually. 
3. What drew you to product management, specifically in the AI/creative space? Tell me about a moment when you realized this was the right path for you.
4. Tell me about a product you use that you feel like has a particularly strong and well defined strategy or direction. What is it about that product that speaks so clearly to you?

## Emergency escape questions 
- Do you have any questions for me about Adobe or the role
