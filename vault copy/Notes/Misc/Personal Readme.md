<About this project> 
This project will have a collection of markdown documents which are taken from my Obsidian vault. A personal notes app which I use to take notes and compose documents. 

There are a few basic types of pages: 
- PgMHome: the major projects I am responsible for. 
- dailyNote: a page created every day that I need to make notes
- People: pages for the major collaborators and teammates I work with
