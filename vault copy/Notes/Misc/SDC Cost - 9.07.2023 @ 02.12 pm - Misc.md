# SDC Cost - 9.07.2023 @ 02.12 pm - Misc

- I was wondering if CKG might be able to save cost to folks like Lr but acting as a check point for assuming a user’s query intent. eg could we save some calls to image processing services by using CKG as a confidence heuristic on wether or not the user actually wants to search by image contents. obvs this breaks down if CKG is itself very expensive
