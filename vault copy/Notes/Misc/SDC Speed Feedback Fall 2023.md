# SDC Speed Feedback Fall 2023
---
## [[Jayant Kumar|Jayant]] 

### Feedback for them 
- I appreciated how responsive and helpful you were in getting me ramped up and read in on SDC and [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] 
	- This was a big help and saved me a lot of time. 
- I think you've done an incredible job managing the technical direction of [[Intent AI Home|CKG]]. It's clear to me that the team enjoys clarity in how models are trained or validated with your direction and guidance. 
- I've felt sometimes you're quick to take on a question, or opinion from [[Vipul Dalal|Vipul]] or [[Ravindra Sadaphule|Ravindra]]'s in some conversation and that this makes it to the dev team. I think your position affords you more latitude to push back on things like this, and defend the teams' time and focus. 

### Feedback for me 
- Got up to speed quickly and was eager to learn 
- Good understanding of goals and where we want to go
- Articulate very well, and roll up info into groups, leads to [[Jayant Kumar|Jayant]] trusting 
	- Gotten message across to leadership 
- More involvement with [[Evaluation|evaluation]] and published list of top burning issues. 
	- What are the pending time bombs for CKG 
	- Getting more hands on with the [[Evaluation|eval]], more feedback around the functionality of the graph 
- Talking to more surface products & PMs
	- Andrei, [[Vic Chen|Vic]] 
	- Going and pitching to these teams. 
- Know at a high level how some of these technologies are used.

### Feedback for them 
- I appreciate your openness and time in helping me get up to speed in SDC and [[Intent AI Home|CKG]]. 
- I've also found conversations/stand up updates with you to be very clear and concise, i've noticed SDC can get a bit ramble-y so this brevity is appreciated.

## [[Josep]] Valls
### Feedback for them 
- I appreciate your willingness to disagree with opinions in technical direction in a constructive way. I've been in a few conversations where questions, push backs, or clarifications you brought up lead us to better conclusion. I'm looking forward to [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] having more of your time in the next few weeks/months it sounds like. 
- 
### Feedback for me 
- CKG has been working in a silo (blessing and a curse) 
	- not a lot of collab 
- I'm already having some impact in comms and collab

### Feedback for them 
- I think you have a very keen sense of tradeoff costs and opportunity costs when it comes to team asks. I see a lot of time/scope discipline and essentialist thinking in how you communicate with leadership and I think that's incredibly important for a team manager. 
- I appreciate your transparency. I personally value that trait a lot in a colleague, especially the EMs I work with. I feel like you've been very forthcoming and considerate to mention info or offer an intuition as I've ramped up in [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] based on your  experience and that's proved helpful to me. 
- One opportunity that came to mind was a bit of org/culture crafting. As CKGs importance to surface teams increases your stock as an org leader with SDC will too, you might think about how this might impact org process or culture going forward. 

### Feedback for me 
- Doing well
	- I ramped up well/fast
	- Open communication and willingness to ask why
	- giving CKG team aircover 
	- Planning and presentations 
- Opportunity 
	- How do we push our vision to [[Ritu Goel|Ritu]]/ravindra, how do we get buy in 
		- Focus on use cases / clear vision gives a sense of trust from leadership 
			- "they're on board, they get it, we can trsut these guys"
	- Continuing to build these relationships with other partner PMs 
		- Live or Die by these 
		- [[Brian Eriksson|Brian]] has done a good job here

## [[Sanat Sharma|Sanat]] Sharma
### Feedback for them 
- I appreciated your help and effort in getting me ramped up in SDC over the last couple months. It was a big time save to me.
- Your frequent slack updates on the dev channel and in standup are helpful as well. On my former team I was much more involved with the engineering, and as a PM I'm frequently working at a little higher level of abstraction. Your updates and info help me build my grounding of what the platform is/is not doing today. 
- One area to think on might be how you communicate and convey the changes and work your doing. I've seen a lot of SDC having some tribal knowledge and an extra wiki embed or breaking down an acronym might go a long way to spreading knowledge, especially with your depth of exp on the CKG project. 
### Feedback for me 
- Quick ramp up on [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] and terminology 
	- updating old pages rather than creating new ones 
	- good comms and docs 
- Focused on prioritization and customer impact 
	- what is the biggest impact thing
	- Streamlining 
	- velocity of releases 
- Improvements 
	- incl. more people in the loop on leadership questions (8 week plan mtg)
		- overall picture wasn't clear on the 8 week plan thing 
		- more direction for the team 
	- Collab with team members 
		- clarity in email updates 
		- Srini and the contextual editor 
	- Asks 
		- team projects 
			- roadmap for contextual editor 
			- [[RAG]] - and etc 
		- Outside of SDC  
	- Roadmap evangelism

## Rida Khan
### Feedback for them 
I know we haven't worked together very much so I was wondering if we might use the time as a bit of a get to know you? 
- What did you do prior to joining Adobe?
- What's the worst part about [[Intent AI Home|CKG]]? 
	- If I told you [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] was going to be used in a new use case on [[Express]], and we expected to 10x the number of people getting intents from [[Intent AI Home|CKG]], what would worry you the most? 
- What are you looking for in out of your relationship and collaborating with PM?

### Feedback for me 
- Great that we're starting to standardize 
	- End goal in mind and cutting down on active workstreams 
	- Starting to build a picture of end goal and vision
- Working with PM 
	- not a clear vision for what the relationship should be, but the info about big picture are super helpful 
	- Qtr view 
- Worst part of [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] 
	- lack of documentation 
	- running locally was even a challenge 
- What if we 10x'd tomorrow 
	- AGT/CGT is pretty locked in 

Meet n greet: 
- Masters degree 
- working on Artemis 
- Santa clara
