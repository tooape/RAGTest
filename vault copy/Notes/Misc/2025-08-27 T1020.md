Message to sam: 
"I installed Vivaldi browser to fuck around with and I can feel myself becoming a linux guy
What if I ran Arch"

there’s these common strata of products where there’s the sort of system or cultural defaults like safari or chrome for browsers, or apple notes, etc. 

Then there's the sphere of more prosumer/enthusiast products that are more capable but still highly productized like Notion or Arc. 

Then you get to things like Obsidian or Vivaldi or something. These require high investment, and knowledge to be successful.
