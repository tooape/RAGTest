# Create the next big photo start up - AM1
Category disruption - everything is already done.

Export settings in desktop not saved for re use in other projects. 
- specific usages, like social different aspect ratios/res/etc. 

Using bridge or another app to cull before [[Lr Home|Lr]]
- Quicker 
- pulls incamera ratings
	- using these to pull in some priority 
photomechanic - culling app
sharing from pixiset
Most issues are around import and cull, and how the files are stored / indexed. 
Clients selecting prints from the cloud album that's been shared to them. 
- sharing isn't as easy

Gallery view in share. 
- showing a client a contact sheet vs a nice looking stylized gallery 

[[Lr Home|Lightroom]] as just a raw file wrangler vs the whole stack manager of imaged end to end. 

# game changes on assignment - AM2
Shooting puffins in wild for a social shoot, wet/rainy, only have phone, no client present 

What do we have to think about as photographers?
- how many photos does the client want? 
- Shoot 20 - 25 keepers, then edit one, then sync edits to others 

videos in [[Lr Home|lightroom]] is 100% about [[Color]] grading, no one wants to clip or anything else in there. 

"Would be good if [[Lr Home|Lr]] had AI as a pick, to rank the cull." 

# Batch draft - AM3 
AI Masking is very good 
AI masking by subject - "Select banana" etc. text input field 
- reflactions 
- foreground
- Head and chest for portraits, but not hands
- Feathering the mask in shot 1, and then applying that to the rest
- individual faces 


Some edit applies to most of a set of images, but not 2 or 3. 
- Man in blue suit in 10 images 
- But in 2 or 3 images there's also a woman in a blue dress, you wound't want the same [[Color]] grade applied there

AI batching where it applies different parts of your synced edits 


# Cull - PM1
Create an album ahead of the shoot. 
Shooting for someone off site who's editing. 

magic DNG, shoot from phone but then choose raw at [[Lr Home|LR]] import. Even if shooting raw on the phone, the image falls apart quickly when editing. 

Full production - 3 people 
- shooter
- edit
- poster

Holiland app? 

How to get the photos into the phone from the camera is the sticking point. 
A digitech changes everything, off loading the culling is the whole thing. 

Hard to cull in [[Lr Home|Lr]]?

Objective AI culling
- Out of focus
- bad exposure
- blink
- etc

Subjective: 
- vary by [[Style Home|style]] (wedding, vs arch, etc.)

After shoot, impossible things


Filter or search by [[Color]] in develop view

## Semantic search 
"northern lights"

"Fog back lit sillouhette" 
Time of day (sun set), people, family 

dosnt need to immediatley return THE photo, but helps you find the parts of the photo you might remember. 
"bride and daughter, 10 years ago"

Taking multiple passes through culls to add stars. 

working with a team of creators 

Everything is imported as a reject. CUlling in vs culling out. Stars are how good the shot is.

searching between catalogs


**Why Searching?**
- Client emails back
- Doing a post or a blog about "Hotels" and I need to go find something from a few years back 
- Re-editing or digging back into a photo from years ago
- "My grandmother passed away, do you have any photos"
- [[Intent Seasonality|Seasonality]] 
	- wanting to recall stuff by season
	- "Summer is coming what summer shots did i not post last year"
- Creating material for a post, blog, a tutorial talk 

Pixiset 

**org system**
- Folders by year and then sub folders within for individual shoots. 
- Index of HDDs for shoots, clients email in and ask for some shot, you can just go find the photo on the drive from the index (a good doc list)
- Client wants on OLD photo, he had to go find a blog post about it he did, and find the date. 
	- Instagram is also used this way. Scroll back until you find some shot, and then look at the year. 


Did you mean? as feedback for results. 

**Auto keywording** 
Desc. as a field which is lexically completely vs the auto Keyword which is just [[Express Traffic Growth - Program Home|SEO]]
[[Express Traffic Growth - Program Home|SEO]] is for the [[person]] reading it, and is less specific. 

[[Express Traffic Growth - Program Home|SEO]] use case is v much about teir blog or something. Internal search is a separate use case. 


# Lessons from the day 
Note: these were C-Pros
There's an interest and a willingness to let AI do more of the driving even beyond search. 
They were totally willing to let AI make determinations about which shots to keep or reject at import, what the best ones might be, and even what kinds of edits to make. 
- They were especially interested in [[Personalization Home|personalization]] in edit [[Recommendations Home|recs]]. 

Star rating is not a good way to handle "best".
the embeddings will also need to serve cases around auto cull.

They'll usually have an image in mind, but just don't remember the details required to find it. They'll organize by client name, or date, but not subject matter. So when they go to write blog posts about "Winter Weddings" or something it can be quite hard. 

Most of what they were interested in was within the scene. But some other metadata will be important here as well.

# Reply to Lirra Hill 

**After ALL the conversations (official and unofficial sessions/convos), what does Lightroom need to do to continue strengthening relationships with the pro community?**
Continuing sessions like this. More than any feature or change I heard specifically get requested, there was an overwhelming sense of "wow they're really listening" that made them feel plugged in. 

**What are the TOP THREE near-term feature requests or feature improvements we should be prioritizing to meet our pro audience needs?**
- Optimizations for Culling and import 
- Communications around improvements and changes 
- Semantic Search

**What are the TOP THREE long-term product changes we should consider to meet the needs of our pro audiences?**
- Design intelligence in the app which would help with things like culling and edits 
- Creating API touchpoints to bring the extensibility ecosystem to desktop
- On-device AI
