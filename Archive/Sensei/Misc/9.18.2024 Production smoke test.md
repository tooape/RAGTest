## Functional

**Scrolling behavior UX** 
Currently scrolling animation does not stop on mouse hover. While the animation is playing, you cannot click on any of the collections. This causes users to have to wait for the whole animation to finish until they can interact with the carousel. Attempting to scroll while the animation is playing results in animation errors. 

**Only text label is clickable, the image thumbnail is not clickable.** 

**Behavior when navigating to "view all"** 
When clicking on "view all" the top assets are carried over from their displayed order in the carousel for only a second or so. After one to two seconds, their order is changed. This is confusing and unclear to users. 

**Duplicate carousels are being displayed**
the same association and assets will be displayed more than once in the list of association carousels. 

**Duplicate assets appearing within a collection.** 

**Associations with more than 2 tokens are being truncated regardless of character length.** 
This is confusing for associations like "cat with X" (hat, box, etc). 

**Search within being persisted across collections/categories.** 
User navigates to collection #1 and performs a search. They then click "back", go to another collection (collection #2), and click "view all", the search term(s) entered in collection #1 are displayed in collection #2.
