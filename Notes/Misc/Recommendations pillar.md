Similar to working with a tutor or mentor; [[Recommendations Home|Recs]] are a means of guided exploration, which help users to navigate the limitless range of ideas they might pursue with their project to get to the one they feel is best for them. 

[[Recommendations Home|Recs]] do this by drawing from multiple areas of understanding and creating useful suggestions. 
These areas of understanding include:
1. Content Intelligence 
2. Design Intelligence 
3. User Intelligence 
4. App Inteligence 

Useful suggestions are things which might help you create something you had in mind or explore a new idea or avenue for your project. 

The suggestions themselves might be anything in the creative process.
1. Adobe's assets
2. The user's own assets
3. Tools
4. Information or docs
5. loose Ideas


With these suggestions you will complete better projects, more easily than ever before. These projects will be things you could not have accomplished alone, and were made better by Adobe's unique understanding of creativity.

[[Recommendations Home|Recs]] require good intelligence on the assets to be able to find them in the right moments for people. And good intelligence on the signals to pay attention to to know when to show these assets.

For intel, in a consumption use case, all thats needed is knowledge of the assets and the user. But in a creation use case we also need to understand: 
- actions 
- tools
- own assets 
- current work 

All [[Recommendations Home|recs]] will need to be [[Style Home|style]] informed. 
[[Recommendations Home|Recs]] in the editor should be in context of what you did in home, and that should be in context of what you did in [[Lr Home|Lr]] 20 minutes ago. 

Having the design intel to know when the canvas sucks, and possibly showing variations at export. 

Recommending combinations of assets:

Three pillars: 
- Content intelligence
