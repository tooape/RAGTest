# user interviews Q4 2023

### Script
Thanks for taking the time! I'm setting up meetings with the users and stakeholders of intent understanding to get a better sense of what kinds of ideas people have about what we're doing, and what we should work on. If it's ok with you i'd like to record the call, do you mind? For the context of this conversation, let's break out intent understanding ([[Intent AI Home|CKG]], CGT, AGT) from the larger [[ILUP]]/Morpheus platform. 

- Taken in isolation, what does the term "intent understanding" mean to you? 
- How do you use our intent understanding right now?
- What do you dislike the most about our intent understanding today?
- If I said we're launching an update that will give you really great intents, near perfect intents that are nuanced and accurate, what kinds of possibilities open up for you and your product?
- What are you tying to accomplish next year 
	- related to [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] or not
- if SDC's intent understanding project vanished tomorrow, how would you accomplish your objectives for next year?
