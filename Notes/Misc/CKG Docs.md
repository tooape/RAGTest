# [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] Docs
---
## Need for docs page 
**User context**
> As the EM & PM of a dev team in Creative Cloud we would like to be able to browse an implementation guide about intent services so that we can understand what these services are, how they might apply to our use case, and how our team can implement them in our app. This way we can avoid time consuming meetings and get an understanding quickly. 

Section outline
- User Guide (in the style of the [next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs))
	- What is Intent Understanding
	- What are the major components / key features 
		- Each section should link to a page with a description for the feature, and some examples
	- Examples of production use cases 
		- SEO
		- Artemis 
		- Null / Low template search 
- DevDocs  
	- API Reference
		- Required and optional request info 
		- Response examples 
	- An architecture diagrams
		- Where [[ILUP]] sits inside USS 
		- Where CKG & intent services sit in side [[Intent AI Home|Intent AI Home]] 
	- Link to our release notes / changelog 

Other req: 
- Should have a text search field 
- Should have a "contact us" link to the [AMA channel](https://adobe.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C064HJTNFTL)

[Link to wiki req for all of this](https://wiki.corp.adobe.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=3041764769)
