## Program name 
Programs are the highest level of organized work in SDC. We will regularly track progress against a thematic or organizational level strategy around a small number of programs. A given team, platform, or service's ongoing work may contribute to one or more programs. 


## Workstream
A workstream is thematic grouping of work. Generally divided along lines of a specific service or technology. 

## Release 
Releases are collections of related milestones that can be shipped to customers for production use. This will typically correspond to a marketed feature or capability in the product surfaces. 

## Milestone name 
Milestones are segments of work that can be incrementally delivered against a larger goal within one Program. Milestones may consist of one or more lower level deliverables, and will generally have corresponding Product Requirement Docs defining their scope and purpose. 

## Deliverable name 
Deliverables are low level units of work that contribute to milestones, and programs.
