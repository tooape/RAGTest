# Overview
The [[typography|fonts]] team is looking to improve the font [[Recommendations Home|recs]] experience in [[Express]] to make contextually driven font [[Recommendations Home|recs]]. Likewise, SDC is looking to create a cohesive and consistant experience for users across [[Recommendations Home|recommendations]]. With [[Recommendations Home|contextual recs]] rolling out in feb (expected ETA), it makes sense to start thinking about how to bring contextual font [[Recommendations Home|recs]] into [[Express]] by leveraging [[Intent AI Home|MINT]] instead of forcing the Fonts team to use another intent platform. 

# Goals 
**1. Deliver an improved font [[Recommendations Home|recs]] experience of the current system**
The current font [[Recommendations Home|recs]] experience in express was built quickly and was a good start. It lacks direct relevance to the canvas however, and has had a consistent UX complaint of constantly changing, creating a confusing experience. We'll seek to improve these areas, among others as the project takes shape.

**2. Leverage the existing work done by both teams up to now**
While some work will be needed to bring intent understanding into the fold with font [[Recommendations Home|recommendations]], and vise versa to query the relevant font families. Large portions of the overall system have been created by both side. Wherever possible, we'll re-use this work to save time, cost, and complexity.  

**3. Enable future evolutions to improve [[Recommendations Home|recs]]**
- styles
- [[Personalization Home|personalization]]
- Additional font families 

# Next steps 
Ivan and I have already met to discuss the initial viability of a collaboration. Next we should start to look into the current platforms. 
- How [[Intent AI Home|MINT]] is inferring intent, what kinds of intents does it show? How many of the font team's intents are covered in [[Intent AI Home|MINT]]?
- What is the current intent system for the fonts team? What libraries are being used? How does it plug into their platform? What other use cases are they powering with this intent system?
