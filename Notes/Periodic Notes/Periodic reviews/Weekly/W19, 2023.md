- Why is everyone coming after me on roadmap? 


# Week in Review
---
_Imagine you're a consultant who's been hired to assess a week in your life._

## 1. Accomplishments 
_Review completed tasks for the past week_
- Got the kanban workshop done ([[Kanban training day 2 - 5.10.23 - Meeting]])
	- Some good conversations and thinking about our process
- [[bundling]] seems to be winding down 
- Browse is moving forward 
- Some interesting ideas about the future of [[audiences]] and [[eventing]]

## 2. Low points 
_What feels disappointing?_
	_Why?_

- Feeling kinda sick on friday 
- Feeling pretty burnt out 
- Somewhat distracted bouncing task to task or thought to thought 
	- Finding work uninteresting 

## 3. Next week 
_Set objectives or goals for the week ahead_
- Need to get the [[best practices]] tickets going 
	- Ping anton about the customization one 
	- Write some notes on the product data one about the most recent case with [long description](https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/DSRS-608?focusedCommentId=36319084&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-36319084)
- Front end roadmap review
	- Think on what we can deliver here for widgets vs the API 
- Backlog grooming


## 4. Further out 
_What's on my mind professionally?_
_What's on my mind personally?_
_What did you find exciting this week?_

- Wondering if "Principle PM is still important to me"
	- I think it is 
- I should really sit down and think out my professional goals and how they differ from my personal ones
