## [[Lr Home|Lightroom]] semantic search PLA
Irina's questions: 
1. Based on the evaluation, there are bias signals: e.g prompts in the weightlifting test set tend to rank images with men higher; prompts in the caregiving set tend to rank images of women higher. Is this something that you believe could be practically addressed now or in the near term?
2. There are instances of human-animal confusion that we classify as denigration: while this is not just limited to certain skin tones, this is expected to be addressed.
3. There are a few instances of no results being returned for some queries (e.g. ‘a leader’, ‘working hard’) — could you please explain why this might be happening?
4. There are reported instances of rendering fewer than expected or no results; would appreciate a comment on this and whether this search behavior is specific to the test set.
5. There was no ideological bias testing in your evaluation so not sure what you meant by that bullet point. Your main evaluation risks were bias, accuracy, and human-animal confusion.
