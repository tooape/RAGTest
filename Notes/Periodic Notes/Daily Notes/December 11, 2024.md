## Assistant [[2025 Roadmap]]
- chatbot to do shit on the editor 
	- EOQ2 for internal beta 
[[Express]] owns super agent, SDC owns product Q&A and search sub agent .


broadly they want query understanding for home
and they want contextualizaiton for chat bot in editor
- canvas contents, etc 


[[Personalization Home|personalization]]: what are the coffee cups which are clicked on most or most useful. 

How can [[Intent AI Home|mint]] take a query, a userID, and a template (asset) and give the ideal result?


## [[Brian Eriksson|Brian]] #meetings/1x1 

- [[Artemis]] needs 
- Clarifying [[Personalization Home|personalization]] 
	- Focusing on in session vs inter-session 
		- venkat's user store plan?
- [[Style Home]] 
	- slow going on annotations 
	- Using the aux data set better 



## #checkins 

**Business goals**
- Owning [[Intent AI Home|CKG]], evangelizing our tech in [[Express]], and ultimately pushing use cases into prod.
	- The big one here is obvs [[Recommendations Home|contextual recs]]
	- Beyond that however i've succeeded in getting [[Intent AI Home|CKG]]/[[Intent AI Home|MINT]] in other areas like search recovery
	- Also, i've built a reputation and relationships within [[Express]] and proved efficacy of our technology 
	- With [[Style Home]] (gradually) coming online i've run early demos and continued momentum there
- Build a roadmap and a vision for my domain 
	- [[Intent AI Home|MINT]] / [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] has a solid vision and roadmap going into 2025
	- I've began building the vision for Recs as a portfolio of products and am getting more involved with [[Brian Eriksson|Brian]] on [[Artemis]] 
- [[Lr Home|Lightroom]] 
	- [[Lr Home|Lr]]'s goals in 2024 were limited but some key discussions came up. 
		- Led the scoping and prioritization discussions for critical bug fixes and improvements which threatened our dev capacity to find a workable solution
			- 10k limit, AC re-design 
		- Leading the Semantic Search POC
		- Improved my relationships with [[Lr Home|Lr]] team 
			- working with Rob, [[Peter Baust|Peter]], Barry 
			- Going to the Summit
		- Launching [[Unwanted Photos in Lr - 9.13.2023 @ 02.19 pm - Misc|unwanted photos]]


Misses: 
- Relationship with [[Amanda Fetterly|Amanda]]
	- new strat is to go bottom up through barbra and alex 
- updates / information sharing across teams / org 


2025 goals: 
- Up level myself / scale my influence
	- set the team up for success without having to drive conversations directly in extreme depth 
- Build relationships with more of [[Express]] 
	- outside of [[Vic Chen|Vic]] / Ali 
- Increase technical expertise 

**Values in action**
- Raise the bar bc of making contextual actually deliverable 
- Create the future for contextual, and [[Style Home]], and getting [[Personalization Home|personalization]] going and building the future vision for [[Intent AI Home|MINT]]


- [x] Talk to [[Varun Sunderajan]] about scaling yourself 


**opportunities for growth**
- Clarifying intent as an entity 
	- "What is intent understanding"
	- sharpen the picture of what intent is 
	- more than the graph, it's all the technologies, embeddings, etc 
	- picture of what intent is beyond what we have right now 
		- where do we have good technology, and where do we have gaps

- [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] is kind of in the background, it's being used in places where we're not getting shine/credit. 
	- We did it, but we didn't get the notoriety 

- [x] Reshape the [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] checkin
	- make the [[Vipul Dalal|vipul]] updates an email etc
