## [[Jolie Steinpreis]] #meetings/1x1 
- Events scheduler
	- Pamela Zoni and Hannah Mitchell were contacts for Scheduler, an Events ontology that makes use of Odin’s [[Intent AI Home|knowledge graph]] and the development happening with that team.
	- Odin? 
- [Canonical adobe data sources Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVN6sFkUU=/?share_link_id=730007536676)

Connecting with [[Concept autotagger|CAT]] 


## [[Vipul Dalal|Vipul]] #meetings/1x1 


- I view the mission for [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] as "becoming adobe's canonical source of understanding the creative process" with the ultimate vision of making creation in Adobe apps this almost frictionless, joyful, magical experience where you feel like you're able to accomplish more creatively than you thought you could. 
	- If we're successful in doing this, then from the user's perspective the apps or surfaces that use [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] will feel less like they just have recommendations than they will feel like there's some digital art tutor in [[Express]] guiding or helping from the background 
- To do this there's a number of tech advancements we're going to need to make (like [[Style Home|style]] understanding and [[Compositional intents|compositionality]]), but we also need to be cognizant around delivering the right incremental value 
	- There's a set of very easy low hanging fruit to go get around contextualizing the editor at a basic level. But once this is done we'll be in a place where we need to go above and beyond that. 
	- The [[Icons]]/elements recommendation case 
		- users have no ability to find things that are visually similar to what they're working with
- Connecting to other systems, Odin, [[Concept autotagger|CAT]], etc 
	- Partly to share intelligence, and partly because we'll need to align on the [[Canonical Node Name|canonical names]] or representations of things

- I've been here 6 months now, is there anything I should start doing? Anything I should stop doing?
