# Notes
---

## Multi-lingual use cases / test cases 
As a baseline, in any language we claim support for, we should be performing at ≥95% of the relevance score for the head, torso, and tail stratified test queries in US English.

We will also need 90% coverage at top1 for the top 500 queries in any language. 

Any supported language should be included in the automated testing suite along with US English to monitor regression across languages.
