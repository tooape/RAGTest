# Notes

Thinking about my managing [[Recommendations Home|recs]] more broadly, and the relationship with [[Amanda Fetterly|Amanda]] and the content team. 

**Conversation with [[Brian Eriksson|Brian]]** #meetings/1x1 
Taking [[Recommendations Home|recs]] as a broader portfolio is a good move because it keeps me from being a platform PM. 
My working with [[Amanda Fetterly|Amanda]] is a hard job but a good move: 
- proves org value (this relationship is not something we've been good at thus far)
- Establishes my credibility with other orgs outside SDC. 
[[Brian Eriksson|Brian]] does not want to work at lockeed martin (what with the missiles and all). 

- [x] Make a plan for [[Recommendations Home|recommendations]] 
- [x] Make a plan for working with Amanda
	- [x] Watch her session back
	- [x] reach out for a "hey we heard you, can we talk about that on-site meeting"

**[[Recommendations Home|Recs]] as a portfolio**
Contextual, artemis, video/mobile artemis
