## [[Ritu Goel|Ritu]] #meetings/1x1 

- Getting APS going 
	- C-Pro zone
	- Agents work 
- Lr Demo 
	- dig in on the alerts and monitoring with Lr
	- Send the Lr email to SDC...

Stock headaches:
- cost of storing embeddings is quite high
- User assets are always doing a smaller lookup in a maximum of 1M assets, stored per shard 
	- but the incoming query will still always hit the full 800M index

Little ownership on the stock side, no one really owns this piece. Customizations and extra intel isn't owned by anyone. 

Assets and content team should be doing these things. 

**APS**
Make a one liner for each of the big ones for next year. 

1. C-Pro - big initiatives 
	1. Lr GA
	2. Agentic 
	3. Semantic search for Ps and Ai 
		1. Venkat is already working on this, loop in

	1. Existing surfaces

## Query Understanding checkin #meetings 

**Asks in priority order**
1. Gather the list of filterable metadata 
	1. Create these concepts in CKG4 and a curated and structured way 
2. List of topics which is relevant to prod use cases 
3. Network of edges which is well groomed

**Wiki changes**
- Granular graph prioritization breakdown 
	- By type in top 500 (abstract)
	- Focus on the metadata in the indices (pure nodes)
		- Stock 
		- Express
		- Lr
		- ...
	- Topics 20k ... 
- Graph stats are hosted somewhere for easy viewing 
- Contributor model broken down at more granular level
- Anshul's model is reviewed 


**Evaluating across domains**
Evaluating CKG and query understanding across different use cases. 

Create a table, where by you have a matrix of the capabilities, and the domains, and then you show which use cases need which capabilities
