## [[Ritu Goel|Ritu]] Staff #meetings 

Need to watch through the [CPro strategy deep dive](https://iatv.adobe.com/media/t/1_1nonqlhc/322691902), and then align the language in the 2026 [[APS]] deck ([here](https://new.express.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:US:061c895a-3857-5c19-8afa-cda687cc38ab?invite=true&accept=true%3Fpreload%3Dsharesheet&promoid=Z2G1FQKR&mv=other)). 

## [[Acrobat|DC]] [[Recommendations Home|Recs]] sync #meetings

**Assets incl in this search:** 
1. PSD
	1. Ps live collab doc
2. AI

## [[Kosta Blank|Kosta]] #meetings/1x1 

[[Style Home|Photo styles]], where are we at? I have time this afternoon and tomorrow afternoon. 

[[Photoshop|Ps Recs]]
- Mobile is a nice to have but i'm putting [[Photoshop|Ps Web]] [[Recommendations Home|recs]] higher in my must nails for Q1 ![[November 18, 2025#Q1 2026 Must Nails]]
- For the plan to migrate contextual recs to the newMM Model in Mintv2, 120RPS is the current peak load on [[Recommendations Home|recs]]
	- maybe 160 - 175 RPS as the target for [[Asim Kadav|Asim]]'s team on the model perf side. 

## [[Intent AI Home|Intent]] Strategy 2026 White-paper #meetings 

- [[Ayush Jaiswal|Ayush]] has [a proposal doc](https://adobe.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/adobesearch/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B9DB15EFA-1F1B-4BF7-873D-4261A7D5D2D4%7D&file=Intent%20AI.docx&wdLOR=c98920335-44CD-6541-9BC3-605E6C0478D8&action=default&mobileredirect=true)

Two modes of interaction 
- Active: search and assistance use-cases require active interaction with the user in the form of queries that they craft. 
- Passive: recommendation use-cases require intent understanding systems to run passively on user-context (current project, geo-temporal attributes, etc.)
