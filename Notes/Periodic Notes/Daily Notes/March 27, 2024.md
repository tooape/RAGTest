### Forming thoughts 
We need to solve a few key problems in [[Intent AI Home|CKG]]

#### Style understanding 
Systematized, 
> HMW join understanding across [[Firefly|FF]] and Express ?


#### Diverging exploration though hierarchy 
Having sufficient density to navigate a graph structure 

#### Signal evaluation 
Simple heuristic or more advanced system 

#### User behavior 
[[Communicator Behavior Signal|user heuristics]] and learned associations 

#### Safety 
How do we need to build our systems to avoid negative user experience? 

What do each of these unlock incrementally? 
How do we align this with express user value? 
- currently [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] is kind of broad, so go for things that are broad

#### Feature shit 
- Category browse pills 


# Meetings

## [[Kosta Blank|Kosta]] #meetings/1x1 

make a wiki page or record my thoughts on capturing the different signals within a project 
- bike meet up is about bikes, and meet ups, both of which will have different associations 
- as you add shit to the canvas, that specific thing becomes less significant 
	- "i already have bike stuff, move on" 

## [[Script for April 2024 demo]] feedback #meetings 
- [[Ritu Goel|Ritu]]


capturing signal for 2nd 3rd order concepts like the meetup 

usign this signal to decied when not to show contextualization and go to defaults
