Setting up some leave behinds...
**[[Intent AI Home|CKG]]**
Most of the roadmap for Q3 is focused on making sure we're putting the best foot forward on [[Recommendations Home|contextual recs]]
- Graph cleanup
- [[Style Home]] 
	- i've already got some stuff around [[Style Home]] and the embedding space idea

And then some work that will bleed into Q4, like further [[Style Home]] push. Deeper thinking about [[Color]] harmony and relationships as well as [[typography|fonts]]. 

Any other requests?

- [x] UXR test to make sure we will get the right data points

[[Artemis]] wasn't included in the Spectrum v3 test plan
