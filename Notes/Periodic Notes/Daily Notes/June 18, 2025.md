**Graph stats**
- unrelated ttopics connected with edges in 3.5.9 will show higher scores artificially 

- We can show artificial associations, but there's no inference. 
- Showing progression of density form A1 to A2

Edge types will be able to show their own evals
- eg USE case A vs B might care about different edge types. 
- More diverse associations

We need our own graph viewer, harasha is working on this. 

Even through alpha 2 / 3: geo/cultrual edges, search behavior, has property, behavior edges aren't in scope yet... 
- alpha 2 might be shareable

- Major themes for alpha-2
    - Node deduplication
    - Content moderation
    - Expansion of semantic and general knowledge edges
    - Intrinsic metrics of node quality
- Major themes for alpha-3
    - Code integration into a single-click pipeline
    - Node and edge expansions to improve coverage
    - Fix high-priority node and edge issues

Leaving someone on the graph at all times. 

[[Josep]] is driling in on inference.

## Intent standup #meetings 

- [[CKG 4.0]] Graph stats are more or less done
- use case stats
	- [[Recommendations Home|Recs]] 
	- Search 
		- homonym disambiguation stuff won't show, because [[Intent AI Home|MINT]] isn't ready for that yet
		- We will be showing better diverse queries for ambiguous queries 

**Using user queries for training the [[Core Affinity Framework|topical ordering]]**
can we train a classification model for the [[Core Affinity Framework|CAF]] work using user queries 


**[[Intent AI Home|SLM]]**
Caching everything over 0.75 confidence for [[pdf to presentation]] use case

## Ps [[Recommendations Home|contextual recs]] #meetings 
Integrating free stock integration to Ps desktop, Amy durocher 
big push at max 2025

Ps desktop Users either love or despise AI but web would love [[Recommendations Home|recs]] 

**Ps Desktop**
- in menu tree
- shown a series of static carousels 
![[Screenshot 2025-06-18 at 09.48.43.png]]

These are ingredients for entry points into other workflows. people are taking stock images as a starting point for a gen fill workflow, some sort of base where they they then go ape shit on top of that. 

Agent workflow is one angle, angled at newer users who don't *know* Ps.
