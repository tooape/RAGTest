## Improving the graph 
- [[March 01, 2024#Thoughts on the graph]]

### General rules for improving the graph: 
- We should focus our effort at L0 ([[global type|GTs]]), L1, and L2
	- in that order
	- The definition of [[global type|GTs]] should be mutually exclusive 
- We should ensure that all child nodes are semantically hyponyms of their parent node 
- We should not duplicate one [[Canonical Node Name]] in multiple place on the graph 

### Plan 
1. GT definition 
2. Complete de-duplication 
3. Audit L1 nodes 
4. Audit intent and scene objects all the way through 
	1. Need to densify edges 
		1. eg. "Spaghetti" should have "italian food" as a parent, with Italian food having two parents: "Italy" & "food"
5. Deny list 
	1. Any node which matches a term from the deny list should be flagged as "deny" in metadata


## Contextual plan 
Once we've improved the graph: 
- Train on template tagging [[Style Home]] 

[[Sanat Sharma|Sanat]]'s idea to use the inference model to go directly to the scene objects. 
Doing this could more accurately describe the image than going form input to intent to association. We could measure the signal lift this gives us over doing this association traversal. 

measure against, blip or clip or whatever the fuck [[CPT]] is using to caption the images. The goal here is to as accurately and complete describe the image as possible while still be able to link into the node IDs within the graph in order to use it's associations, and retrieval.

## Intent leads #meetings 


- [x] Add definitions to the terminology page 
- [x] Add clarifications to the implementation plan
- [x] Add info to strategy or something about all of contextual being an info retrivial problem. 
	- the caption shit 
	- the manhattan poodle example of returning useable intelligence
