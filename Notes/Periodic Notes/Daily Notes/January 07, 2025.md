# Meetings

## Grooming #meetings 

- [x] Getting a view of what kinds of work are in the protfolio board 
	- What's a POC vs some random task vs an incoming ask, etc
	- Do this w labels?

Asks for the various workstreams

**Precision intent**
1. Regex deployed?
	1. Ranker team [[Evaluation|eval]]?
	2. Other teams?
2. Scheduling [[SLM]] evals

**Stock asset affinity**
In stage [[January 15, 2025]], need to schedule [[Evaluation|eval]]


**[[Style Home]]**
Critical that we continue some momentum here. 
1. When can we evaluate a model 
2. 

**Sustaining work** 



## [[Ritu Goel|Ritu]] #meetings/1x1 

Talking to [[Ravindra Sadaphule|Ravindra]], [[Brian Eriksson|Brian]], [[Kosta Blank|Kosta]] about our platform obligations, and how to continue to evolve our core intelligence. 

Stock affinity model in stage next week, scheduling an [[Evaluation|eval]]. Language is probably next there, starting with just node translations into a few languages. 

**Stock**
Q2: 
- Query local affinity models built by stock
	- falls under [[Multi-Language 2025|multi-lingual]]
	- germany and double byte
	- we should be doing this in [[Express]] as well
- Decompounding in dictionary is being turned off 
	- We'd consider this language AI, which is under the [[Intent AI Home|intent AI]] space

Japan and Korea are the bigger places for stock

FY25:
- T1
- T1.5 (J&K)
- Brz
- Ind
- [x] [[Lr Home|Lr]] req for languages 

**[[Lr Home|LR]] seach**
are we using ES8.15 ANN?

Tests:
1. how good is the A1 space
2. can we do hybrid
	1. embedding + metadata
3. Cost, infra, etc.
	1. Have Anuj work on [[Lr Home|Lr]] 

**Relocation**
SF job offer ?

Over all [[Intent AI Home|intent AI]] has a few buckets (go back to prior 1x1s, shes talked about this before)
- MM
- [[SLM]]
- [[Intent AI Home|Intent AI Home]]
	- spell checker
	- etc

that graphic slide they talk about of squares

Quarterly big buckets 


## Video intent roadmap #meetings/1x1 

- What are the video needs
	- Temporal editing
	- [[Recommendations Home|Contextual recs]]?

For H1 they're only looking at transcript search (lexical and semantic).
