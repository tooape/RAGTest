- Artemis roadmap Q1 2025
	- ![[image (13).png|500]]



## roadmapping 
I have two vectors of responsibility. 
- [[Intent AI Home|MINT]] / [[ILUP]]
- [[Recommendations Home|Recs]]

## Preset personalization in lightroom 
Per [[[Peter Baust|peter]] on slack](https://adobe.enterprise.slack.com/archives/D05NGV9HCV8/p1736530312755159) the goal is to: "provide people with slider settings which could be used to improve the photo." 

"Improve the photo" breaks down to: 
- What is this an image of, or what is it about ?
	- This is a contextualization problem 
- What kind of look might be cool or interesting 
	- This is a personalization problem
- How do i achieve that look 
	- This is an AI precision problem
