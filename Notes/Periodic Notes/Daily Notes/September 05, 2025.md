How much of "AI SLop" is bc the models are shit or uninteresting, and how much is bc every shitty idea someone has can now be quickly made where as previously they would have had to work at it (friction)

## [[Umang Bista|Umang]] #meetings/1x1 
Intro: 
- Former CPF guy
- 10yrs at adobe
- Focused on DC and video understanding now

finding PsD tool useage to ID a painter from a UI designer, and looking at what they do... 

Context to layout 
1. blank canvas kick starter

Could someone show up and say "i want to do a scene of a dog on a beach with X and Y and Z" and it spits out some sketch or trace layer idea where even if shit is misaligned or kinda shit looking (it could even straight up Picasso-style throw stock content in there) you're just tracing it on a new layer or re-doing it all so it just helps you think about how to get going.

## [[Photoshop|PsW]] Recs #meetings 

Working within Lr edit panel. 


## Recs standup #meetings 

Sync w [[Brian Eriksson|Brian]] on the [[Photoshop|PsW]] [[Recommendations Home|recs]] stuff. 
Differentiate the PoC vs the actual implementation where the PoC is basically just a port of the old Lr shit. 

## [[Ritu Goel|Ritu]] #meetings/1x1 

She never actually showed up... 
### [[Lr Home|Lr]] 
**Agent**
Reached out to the PoCs [Rob mentioned](https://adobe.enterprise.slack.com/archives/D03T3GAG8JZ/p1753803893666839), the EM had little to say, PM was OOO, they tried to connect me with another group and they never wrote back. I can apply more push. 

**POC Demo**
PoC meeting earlier this week with Vinay and [[Satheesh Akkinepally|Satheesh]] 

**Cost**
Cat vs [[Intent AI Home|MINT]], CAT kind of looks better but it's 3x more...can we prioritize getting [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] 4 and [[Intent AI Home|MINT]] v2 in prod?
answer from Ritu: ... Just index CAT and move on... 
### Intent 
It's all agents all the way down, everyone wants a search agent. 
- prompt understanding → CAF, etc... 

[[Intent AI Home|CKG]] 4 hand tuning testing. 


### Enterprise content
Just fire a 2nd query and fuckin call it a day. 
- Lr, FF past creations, express → unified index now...
