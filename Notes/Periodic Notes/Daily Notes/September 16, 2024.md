#checkins self ran a roadmap meeting and demo to Ian & org

- [x] Make an AB test charter for aditya 
- [x] finish ian deck, and demo??
- [x] whats next for [[Intent AI Home|mint]] team?


These results are fine, they're topically related, pleasant looking. But it's not "wow, express is crazy, those are the coolest hiking boots i've ever seen, with this asset I could totally go ..." and I know we have these things. So my call to action for you all is just to try this, and engage in a dialog with me and the SDC team. Your knowledge of the product, our content, and communicators are whats going to make this strategy a success going forward.
