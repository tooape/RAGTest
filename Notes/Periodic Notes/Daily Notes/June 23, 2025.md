# Notes

[[Vipul Dalal|Vipul]] wants to hear about evaluating for assistant, not [[Recommendations Home|recs]]. 

## [[Photoshop]] 

### Supplemental content 
**Backgrounds**
> As a Ps user creating a piece of content, I would like to be able to quickly see backgrounds which are not distracting and related to what I'm currently working on. This way I can create a complete asset without having to spend time searching for or creating a generic background for my subject. 
- We shouldn't use [[Express]]'s definition here. We can leverage the stock data around having white space in the image. 

**Secondary Elements**
> As a Ps user creating a piece of content, I would like to be able to quickly see foreground elements which are  related to what I'm currently working on. This way I can create a more complete scene. 
- Design assets + [[Icons]] 

### Reference content 
> As a creator working on a composition or illustration in Ps, I would like to be able to quickly get relevant pieces of reference for my project. This way I don't have to leave the app and search for a pose, perspective, [[Color]], or other reference detail to use. 

EG:
![[hq720-1.jpg]]

![[hq720.jpg]]
### Personal content 
> As a Ps creator working on a project for a client, I would like to get the relevant images from a recent photoshoot as I work on my project. This saves me from having to search through my whole [[Lr Home|Lr]] Catalog every time I need to get an image. 

Recommending assets from the user's own CC library. 
- Other PSDs
- [[Lr Home|Lr]] Photos 
- [[Express]] projects 
- Previously licensed stock images 
- Images they've uploaded from their HD
	- They may have reference images they like and want to get

**History of the thing**
Unlocking express features in acrobat, to boost express MAU. 
Gen image and edit image were the first. 
They're 50+% of express MAU. 
Next best action within Express. 

**Present day**
Selecting text as a prompt, and trying to generate an image with it. Less than 10% gen asset place rate. 90%+ drop and do not place the FF image. 

Acrobat studio will have express premium permissions. 

**Reader Recs**
Document level prompt being sent to us. 
Static content curated for them, plus our recs.

**OKRs**
1. MAU - logged in or logged out users using express features outside of express
2. Success rate - assets clicked out of results and placed on a doc
