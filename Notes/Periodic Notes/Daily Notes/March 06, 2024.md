Technical implementation for [[Style Home]]


### Templates 
We should start by looking back at what the team had done with tagging template [[Style Home]] back in the day. 
We should re-evaluate some of those templates, and ideally look at building a golden set to use. 
- I'll need to be able to view the templates, and their [[Style Home|style]] in order to judge adherence 

[[Color|Colors]]
- 2 factors, categorization, and [[Color]] harmony 

[[Color]] harmony can be a classification problem where we define in embedding space how close to perfect harmony some set of [[Color|colors]] needs to be to adhere to that harmony, and then build a classifier.
