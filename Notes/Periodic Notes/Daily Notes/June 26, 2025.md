## [[Acrobat|pdf]] [[Recommendations Home|recs]] PRD 

In lieu of a full and complete PRD, i'll create a project skeleton for Recommendations in Acrobat. 

### July 2025 

The goal of the July 2025 release is to support contextual recommendations on Acrobat reader for logged out users. This release will be in English only. 
No net new functionality will be created. The recommendations will be based on a summary of the whole document which will be sent to SDC as a long text input. 
Recommendations will be returned to the client based only on this text input.

## Q3 / Q4 Goals 
Once the initial use case is proven out we'll expand scope to other surfaces: 
- Acrobat web
- Acrobat pro (logged in user)

We'll also expand to other languages in Q4 / Q1'26 as they become available. The priority will be on T1 and then T2.
