## Roadmap review #meetings 

### Talk track 
**Slide 1**
Currently we might think of [[Recommendations Home|recommendations]] as only the recently launched [[Recommendations Home|contextual recs]] in the editor. But this under cuts the larger vision we see for the space. In the years to come [[Recommendations Home|recs]] will have less to do with endless carousels of "you might also click" and instead encompass a wider landscape of suggestions for content, tools, your own files, and even ideas and inspiring new creative directions to explore. Like working with a tutor or a mentor, these [[Recommendations Home|recommendations]] will not only speak to things which are commonly used together but also uniquely relevant or interesting to you, aesthetically cohesive and compelling, and come together to help you explore your own ideas in a guided or semi-guided way. 
~~But more than the current state of recommenders where user impression and click data inform the ranking, we envision something which also incorporates some ground truth intelligence.~~ 

**Slide 2**
The current state of the art in recommenders are usually found in commerce, or in recent years social media, specifically tiktok. While these platforms have really incredible recommenders they focus on finding the right content for you to consume or watch or buy. The space for creative [[Recommendations Home|recommendations]], remains largely unsolved. 
Adobe is uniquely positioned here being the industry's defector creation company to answer this need, and doing so will further advantage our position as *the* place where creators and communicators ideas and projects can flourish. 

**Slide 3**
This addresses a major sticking point for our users. Creativity is hard. Shaping the ideas you have into pixels is a very very difficult task, something might not work quite the way you thought, ideas might change, needs for the project might change, and all of this can leave users guessing about how to move forward when working on something. Especially in the Express communicator segment, where most users won't have the expertise or insight to know exactly why something isn't working, or what to do next. 
This is our opportunity for [[Recommendations Home|recommendations]]. How might we help guide users through this creative journey and end up with a project they're proud to export and share, as quickly and easily as possible?

**Slide 4**
The specific shape that this guidance takes might shift over the course of this creative journey however. Early on in their journey they might be looking for broader ideation or a way to quickly see a lot of different concepts for their project. 
Likewise they may have a very small, specific need, and are just looking for a quick adjustment to something they already have.

If they do have a larger vision, and need to start a template or a project, they'll need not only contextual assets as shown today but easy ways to change or experiment with styles and aesthetic touches. They may want to combine photos from their camera roll or their lightroom catalog with audio, or design assets which match the look and feel. They may also not know when a project lacks over all aesthetic cohesion, or has poor readability and layout when they go to export. All of these are areas where we see an opportunity to bring our intelligence to help the users navigate all these choices and help them form the project they dreamt of.  

**Slide 5**
To do this we'll invest in a few core pillars of technology. These aren't meant to show specific or independant systems as much as areas which in combination will power these experiences i've described. 

First we'll need an understanding of content. The ability to break down and understand a canvas, an image wether from stock or the user's own, some piece of video, or the choice of Fonts. 

Second we'll need to have an understanding of design. Anything someone makes in Express will have some the aesthetic language which we need to not only be able to understanding but also interact with in a logical way. 

We'll need to understand both the individual user in question, and the preferences of wider groups of users across CC. The ideas, tools, or assets we might recommend a user cannot be generic or universal if we expect to deliver impact on their creative journey. 

Finally we'll need to understand our own ecosystem. What are the pieces of data like brands or stock licensed images a user has access to, what are the various tools or quick actions available to them, and what are they actually doing in the app? 

These 4 areas make up the heart of our foundational intelligence, and achieving our goals will require a multi-year road through these pillars. But we can start delivering value in the interim.

**Slide 6**
I've not gotten the roadmap view as clearly laid out here as I'd like but I can speak to the goals here. 

First there's an investment in those pillars of intelligence I mentioned. While there's a lot of areas there we're looking at, style and [[Personalization Home|personalization]] are the most important. These are massive opportunities for us, functionality express is especially interested in, the agents work, and something we have to deliver on. 

Next there's the express integrations side, where we'll look to not only expand the existing contextual editor [[Recommendations Home|recs]] surface area into things like the all tab, but also expanding the kinds of [[Recommendations Home|recs]] we can show. Recommending things like templates, audio clips or sound effects, and quick actions. 

Then there's the emerging use cases like internationalization, new modalities, and precision language understanding. 

### Feedback 
better alignment between sections of the deck. 

net new work not clearly ID'd, how to we collect all the prior work.

## Ritu #meetings/1x1 

**From roadmap session**
takeaways were:
- lack of cohesion across sections
- Needing more clarity about connection between some of these areas 
	- Investment in tech
	- style vs [[Personalization Home|personalization]] 
	- Legacy [[Recommendations Home|recs]] around express plan 
- The vision, the need and importance, and the tech areas were good / clear 
- The themes of style and [[Personalization Home|personalization]] stuck. 

Should I do a pre-read (un official) with Amanda / Vic? 
- want to make sure the language of the user journey is the same as theirs

**Feedback from 1x1**
COllectionng one offs like fonts and seasonal/trending. Investment in flywheel. 
User flow being about the user journey and not the surface in express. yuou can be on canvas and still have needs for ideation/inspo, and not know what you want.

add a single hit slide; top 5 things for 1H. SDC capabilities, what are we working on (style, personal, etc.)

Arch breakdown; somewhat abstract, 

**Other areas:**
- relocation movement?
- Miss out on RSUs or is that part of relocation pay adjustment?

## [[Intent AI Home|MINT]] Checkin #meetings 

- wider view of arch diagram, safty features, etc
