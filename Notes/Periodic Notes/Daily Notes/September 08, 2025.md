## [[Ritu Goel|Ritu]] #meetings/1x1 



[[Photoshop|Ps Web]] use cases being a driver for CKG4? 
- doing a stage eval for [[Photoshop|Ps Web]] 
	- "for creator use cases"

APS / Q4 jump start 

**QU roadshow**
take the QU slides out of the pt3 deck from the product summit: 
- just expanding this with examples of increasing complexity 
- SRLs of "my XYZ" etc, 
- What's possible now, what's in Q4, what's TBD...
The existing content goes one level deep, show the second level of depth. 
Tell them about relevance not lemmatization. 

**APS prep**
- Start a PgM doc
	- big bets
		- CKG4
		- Agentic stuff 
By segments (C-Pro, etc) or surfaces ([[Photoshop|Ps Web]], etc). 

SDC Pillars, what is intent doing for each:
- unified 
- Contextual 
- Agentic 

POV of where this tech might be in the uber use case sense.
