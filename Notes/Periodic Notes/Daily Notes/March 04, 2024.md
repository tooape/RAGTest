## Template behavioral data and intents review #meetings 
From Venkat

Improving ranking and recall for [[Artemis]] templates
Each template has true impressions, clicks, exports 

How do we, given a set of 3 returned intents, hmw determine the set of two which are most similar
![[dot_product_components.png]]


the problem is that we're correctly identifying the first thing. 
In a template about great recipes for children baking, we're IDing baking and stuff around baking. We're not getting the kid or the recipes. 

We need to use hierarchy, to say "ok the top 3 were all from some tree structure in the same L1 tree. go to another L1 tree and return the intents there"
