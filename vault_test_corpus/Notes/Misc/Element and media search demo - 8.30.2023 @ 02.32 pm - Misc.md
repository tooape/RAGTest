# Element and media search demo - [[August 30, 2023|8.30.2023]] @ 02.32 pm - Misc
---
## Goal of demo 
Currently, elements and media in [[Express]] are not related to the template, or the canvas contents at all (eg. [[Screenshot 2023-08-30 at 2.37.41 PM.png]]). [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] may be able to produce high quality query terms by using it's intent understanding of the canvas to power these lists. 

The objective of the demo is to show [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] powering recommended media and elements based on a combination of two factors: 
- the chosen template
- the other contents of the canvas 

### Demo site
- The demo should allow the user to select or provide a template and return the top 50 results in each collection of element (Design asset, background, shapes, icons) and media (photos, video, audio) for the given template. 
- The demo should allow the user to select wether or not other canvas contents are used in the intent retrieval. 
	- How would we do this? Pick from a short list of fonts/colors/other elements to "include on the canvas"? 
- The demo should also show a list of the intents used in the query for elements
