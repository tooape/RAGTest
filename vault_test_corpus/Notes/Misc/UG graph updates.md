# Use case
Like [[Express]], and the communicators who use it, our graph can be thought of as a living, breathing thing. In any given day of queries, recommendations, exploration, and photo uploads different parts of our graph will be used more frequently from different types of users in different parts of the world. This is data we should be using in our intent and [[user understanding]] systems since it's so signal rich and so readily available to us. This data gives us insight into evolving changes in aggregate user behavior, intention, and semantic meaning. 
For instance a "Trending" section is a mainstay in any social media app. These lists are based on that day's  big topics of conversation (if not even more frequent), and you only need to click into a topic to see where the social conversation has shifted that minute. Users have grown accustomed to this kind of experience to the extent that some social apps are based almost solely on this kind of momentary topical focus. [[Express]] is hardly a social app, but the users who frequent the app will by nature have some aggregate collective behavior day over day similar to a social app. Likewise digital creation and the culture it lives within is always evolving, and [[Express]] will feel stale or prosaic if it can't keep pace with these evolutions. 
While we will always enforce some curatorial judgement on the kinds of content that belong on [[Express]], or what content should enjoy promotion on the more trafficked parts of its experience. It's inefficient, slow, and ineffective for us to try to place tastemaker in the fine grain details of trends in [[Express]]. Our intent and [[Personalization Home|user understanding]] services are much better placed to handle these ongoing tasks.
