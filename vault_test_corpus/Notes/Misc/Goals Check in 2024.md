- [x] Add Goals to Workday

## Workday write up 
As discussed, I'll take responsibility for four major goal areas this year: 

First and foremost my goal is to take ownership of the Contextual Discovery in Express. This incorporates delivering the major technology pieces in intent understanding to improve the quality and granularity of our intelligence. Evangelizing our capabilities and tech within the Express ecosystem. And as a result, delivering impact on the OKRs Express has laid out (especially within the Content Pillar). 

I'll work to improve the operational excellence of the intent understanding team, and how we work with our partner teams in both Express and around SDC. 


I'll work on the vision and strategy for Intent Understanding and the role it plays in the wider DME landscape. This will take into consideration the work needed to mature the platform beyond the key use cases of the next quarter or two, and allow us to grow into the future. It will also layout expected impact to areas like:  
- Assistive workflows 
- Search Performance 
- Stock discoverability 

Finally I'll partner with the Lightroom team, to keep search performant and functional, as well as consider tradeoffs and constraints of new proposed projects from the Lr team.
