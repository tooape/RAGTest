## Talk track 

### What is a knowledge graph? 
All knowledge graphs are made up of pieces of information or data (which are called nodes), and the relationships that connect them (called edges). 
Both of these can have some unique properties, for instance nodes might have metadata like type, or language, or popularity. And edges might have data like weights. 

The main reason to build some body of info up as a graph, rather than a regular data base is because it lets us browse this data in far more useful ways, especially if some of these relationships aren't mutually exclusive or deterministic. Graphs let us represent a lot more complexity than a traditional relational database. 

But graphs don't have to be super complex, in fact most sets of data could be represented this way if you want. For instance I use an app called Obsidian for notes which has this view that shows each text file I've made as a node, and whenever I reference a file from another file, it makes an association between the two. This means three things: 
1. I can browse these relationships as I go back through my notes. Going from my CKG note, to my 1x1s where, to my express feature workstream notes. 
2. I have have a knowledge graph about the knowledge graph I work on.
3. I'm a big nerd. 

### getting artsy 
So now we understand what a graph is, why it's useful and how data can be represented as a graph... How does all this help a creator or a communicator? As I mentioned before, you can build a graph out of anything, so our's is made up of creative info. I'll get a little more specific later but for now, consider CKG as representing data centered around 3 areas:
1. The creation someone is working on 
2. The actions they make to create something 
3. The data and tools they use 

So now we have our data represented as nodes, we've built relationships tying them together as the edges...How do we get some usage out of this thing? Simply put we use AI inference models to take some user input, wether an image, text, video, a search query, and *infer* what parts of the graph are most useful here, we can then look at what other parts of the graph are related and make use of all these relationships we've modeled out. 
This is one of the biggest value props in a knowledge graph. It lets us take all the infinite variations of creation and art a user might throw at us and translate all that novel creativity into some known data we can use to understand this work. 
Your brain does this all the time when presented with new information. Imagine you go to an art museum and see a new painting, immediately you might start to think "oh it's more impressionistic than literal, or it's from a Spanish artist, it's about their spouse, it's communicating the theme of love". What you've done is approximate new information with your mental model. Then, with these categorizations you might think "oh that reminds me of other paintings about love, or a book I read once about spanish art, or I really like that color of orange".

Our Intent Understanding is performing these same kinds of tasks for our users in Express. Which brings us to the big picture for our intent understanding. 

- To become Adobe's canonical source of understanding the creative process.
- Our vision is to make creation with Adobe products seamless, joyful, and nearly effortless.

User's will never really see CKG directly, but over time they'll see it's impact all over. CKG is kind of like an art tutor, hanging out in the background. 

### How does it work

CKG is just one part of a system within USS called Intent Understanding and Language Platform ([[ILUP]]). This acts as a kind of Traffic controller helping to direct requests around the system. When a request comes in to do some intent understanding, [[ILUP]] will fire up the inference models, and then search the graph. 

While where's a lot of moving pieces in here and each of these things can be updated separately, and used independently. I want to call out that you don't have to worry about this complexity. You can get all of this intelligence returned in the same request, at the same time as any search request. Any time you want intent understanding you can have it. 

Now let's talk a little bit more about what's in the graph. 
Firstly nodes have a few different flavors, this list isn't exhaustive but it gives some idea about the kinds of data we've represented as nodes. Actions are things like "generation request" or "query" or "add photo"
Next we have a few types of elements, things like icons, fonts, colors, images 
Then we have intents, which are generally descriptors of the topic of some user's work. Are they making a birthday invite, a lost dog poster, are they advertising a business? 
And then tools, which are the capabilities they have at their disposal within Express.  


The graph itself is structured like a tree, with layers of nodes that belong to their parent node. This lets us "drill down" or "move up" this hierarchy structure as we see fit. So given some very esoteric image and asked to return intent understanding for it, if we thought it was a woman's leather jacket but weren't very confident, we could simply say "women's fashion" and know we were a bit vauge, but on the right track. It also lets us browse these directed relationships.
