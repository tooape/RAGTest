Milestone 0 
while the ultimate goal is a model for connecting natural language to [[Intent AI Home|MINT]] we'll start by solving some clear use cases as quickly and simply as possible. 


Milestone 1 
If and when a user gives us a longer string of text, how can we extract the most understanding, or useable signal, from that input? 
Once we've done this, how can we turn that signal into the best results?

Milestone N 
Multimodal use cases: 
- Prompt augemented artemis
