## Key Focus Areas

### Lightroom Search & Recommendations
- Heavy focus on [[Lr Home|Lightroom]] search rollout with testing and [[Evaluation|evaluation]] planning
- Working on lens/camera name processing and metadata extraction ([[NER & SRL|NER]] models)
- Analytics implementation for search events and performance tracking with [[Anuj]]
- Preparing for MAX deliverable due end of July/mid-August
- Confirming requirements with [[Peter Baust|Peter]] on shooting settings scope

### Acrobat PDF Recommendations
- Major push on [[Acrobat|PDF]] [[Recommendations Home|recommendations]] for September 2025 launch
- Natural language search across documents with [[NER & SRL|NER]] integration
- [[Multi-Language 2025|Multi-language]] support refinement and requirements gathering

- VLM-based judgment systems for search result assessment
- Test case development for CKG and ranking strategies

### Cross-Team Collaboration
- Regular 1:1s with key stakeholders ([[Ritu Goel|Ritu]], [[Kosta Blank|Kosta]], [[Brian Eriksson|Brian]], [[Tracy King|Tracy]], [[Francois Guerin|Francois]])
- DVA demos showcasing [[Style Home|style]] [[Recommendations Home|recommendations]] in video editing

## Key Meetings & Decisions

### Program Coordination
- **Lightroom WG**: Testing coordination with Rithika
- **Recommendations Program**: PDF multi-language list refinement
- **Intent Assistive**: SLM grounding requirements and translation needs
- **Query Understanding Checkin**: Core affinity L1 model completion, NER training data expansion

### Strategic Sessions  
- **DVA Demo**: Video [[Style Home|style]] transfer and contextual recommendations
- **Acrobat Ask Me Anything**: September release requirements and NER scope
- **CCD/CCH Product QU**: Updated query-product affinity model requirements

### 1:1 Strategic Discussions
- **[[Ritu Goel|Ritu]]**: QU expectations clarity, creative recommendations expansion
- **[[Kosta Blank|Kosta]]**: Competing priorities between SRL and DC actions
- **[[Francois Guerin|Francois]]**: QU system logical flow and discovery hub UI mockups
- **[[Tracy King|Tracy]]**: Evaluation frameworks and user intent classification

## Upcoming Deliverables
- Lightroom search MAX deliverable (end July/mid-August)
- Acrobat PDF recommendations rollout (September 2025)
- Intent AI ILUP integration (September release)

## Cross-Program Themes
- **Contextual Intelligence**: Making recommendations and search more contextual across all surfaces
- **Multi-Language Scale**: Coordinated approach to internationalization across Intent, Recommendations, and Query Understanding
- **Evaluation Rigor**: Establishing consistent evaluation methodologies across programs
- **Production Readiness**: Focus on shipping capabilities while building foundational systems

The month demonstrated intensive work on shipping production features (Lightroom, Acrobat) while building foundational capabilities (Query Understanding, Multi-language) for future releases.
