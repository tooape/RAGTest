## What are the most interesting thoughts, posts, writing or ideas you ran across this month?
- One thing that's really stood out to me this month is my own autonomy in decision making and shaping my time. 
	- This started because of the sensei move, i felt more justified in declining/skipping a bunch of shit and ended up getting more done. 
	- Like the [whitepaper](https://wiki.corp.adobe.com/display/ACDS/Short+Term+Product+Strategy)
- Obsidian is now much more powerful for me and I feel more able to find and control info in it.
