#  Week 44 in Review 
_Imagine you're a consultant who's been hired to assess a week in your life._ _Starting with a brain dump of anything on your mind..._  


## 1. Accomplishments 
_Review completed tasks for the past week_
- My [[Chris Hedge Mentorship - 11.9.2023 - meeting|discussion with chris]] was very helpful in shaping my thinking around the [[CKG 2024 Strategy notes|2024 roadmap]] 
- [[SDC Speed Feedback Fall 2023]] was good, people seem appreciative that I'm here. 

## 2. Low points 
_What feels disappointing?_ _Why?_
- Didn't make much actual progress on the [[CKG 2024 Strategy notes|2024 roadmap]]
- Can't seem to get email updates right. Wrong distro or wrong content. I'll need to think more about how i'm writing / organizing these. 

## 3. Next week 
_Set objectives or goals for the week ahead_
- writing out the [[CKG Vision Doc]] and making some progress on the cycle / cycle planning. 
- Making the most of my time in SJ/SF

## 4. Further out 
_What's on my mind professionally?_ _What's on my mind personally?_ _What did you find exciting this week?_
- Need to think about how i'll build the relationships im going to need in order to be successful running [[ILUP]]
- How do I become a pseudo product group leader/director
