# Notes
---

- need to get the retrieval logic thought about for the association carousels 
- Need to consider the impacts [[Style Home|style]] might have 

### [[Color|Colors]] PM

- How are the trending [[Color|colors]] created? How often are the updated? 
- How are any of the [[Color]] pallets in the trending section stored? 
- Do you have any user data for created/exported [[Color]] pallet sets? 
- [[Color]] approximation 
	- Do they allow any sRGB hexcode or is there some de-duping?

Hi Hep, finally got some time to get some thoughts together.

## Template -> intent feedback with [[Ritu Goel|Ritu]] #meetings 
- [[Style Home]] & [[Color|colors]] 
- are photos relevant to the template
	- would you use one 
- Why would people use some associations 
	- "restaurant menu" is dumb as an image for a promo post on insta 
	- how do we populate **useful** image carousels 
		- stop showing BBQ things, start showing me backyards and picnic tables
