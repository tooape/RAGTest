## Design questions #meetings 

- UX of contextualization results 
	- How much would we display?
		- how many collections might we want to show?
			- Would we show any individual collections at all?
	- Would we display these results by topic (cat, birthday cake, etc) or by element type (photo, design asset, etc)?
		- Just displaying the results as a flat list? 
			- Interleaving of collections/results from different collections
		- How much metadata will be shown? 
			- Would we name the collections?
- Relevance strategy 
	- The considerations around thresholding, number of associations to display, the logic of those associations
		-  We have several controls over precision vs exploration
		-  Thresholds aren't going to always be the same 
		- Similarity vs. Relevance
	- How will we want to show [[Color]] cohesion?
		-  Hard and fast, exploratory? 

- [x] Think about how to work with [[Amanda Fetterly|amanda]]'s team on figuring out the right diversity/thresholding stuff
- [x] make a graphic about how intent understanding works in [[Intent AI Home|CKG]]
