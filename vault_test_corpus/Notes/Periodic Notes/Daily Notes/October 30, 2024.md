Overindexing on indian stuff

Issues: 
- multiple subjects 
- Too spesific of nodes, amking assumptions 
	- High school students vs HS senior
- Over indexing and the whole result set being skewed 
- race
	- Indian
- Age
	- we don't have middle age stuff 

compositionality: 
woman in coat, wearing glasses
- winter or rain coat
- sun or eye glasses
- gender = woman
