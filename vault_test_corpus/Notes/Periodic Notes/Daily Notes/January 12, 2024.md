## [[Evaluation|Eval]] methods #meetings 
- All of this is about creation intent
	- not the other [[Query Intent Type|QIT]] types
- Goals/outcome for both online and offline stages of [[Evaluation|eval]]
- stats
	- not just the % of relevant but also the counts of irrelevant, and the patterns between text heavy vs image heavy templates
- Quality of associations is more important than diversity for now 
	- focusing on diversity for now 
	- Focus on foundation 
- for the mix of illustrations and photos in the results 
- How do we evaluate the coverage of a user project's found intents 
	- 30-40% start from scratch 
	- "are we directionally good or not?"
- adding incomplete project and complete project -> intent evaluations 
	- Simulate different elements added to blank canvas, different contextual data
