Semantic search is the only hardline commit, quick action edit assistance is the next furthest along in R&D. 

**Semantic data outside search**
- Assistant - Quick actions 
	- semantic awareness and assistance in the edit side
	- helping people perform more complex edits by way of abstracting the underlying adjustments into a meta slider 
- assistance for organize activities
	- Classic & cloud 
	- mobile 
		- do not create albums at all, or just use the camera roll 
			- More interesting views, which aren't albums 
				- time, place, etc
- Share
	- Creating a share link and auto-suggesting a name

**Local Search**
- on device search and indexing 

**Gen anywhere, consume anywhere**
