## Contextual PRD Review #meetings 
Just [[Kosta Blank|Kosta]] and I 

- [x] Respond/amend PRD based on the wiki comments 

## [[Color]] questions #meetings 

1. Any info on how the logic of [[Color]] generalization is written?
2. When / how might we access the [[Color]] theme data 
	1. Intent -> harmony model
	2. Harmony popularity 
	3. Stock asset IDs?
3. Harmony creation logic / model 
	1. Starting from blank case where a user is incrementally adding [[Color|colors]]. how migth we have a next best [[Color]] prediction?
	2. How might we put up some guardrails so they don't add 2 million [[Color|colors]] 


### Generalization 
bucketization just ends up being an arbitrary line 
- stick to 100s of [[Color|colors]] 
- balancing the auctual user need, paradox of choice dosn't blind them
- dithered, incl saturation/brightness band

### harmony 
we need more signal
cat + [[Color]] isn't enough

what are the [[Color|colors]] that we as humans bucket into stuff


Jose Eqovara 
- connect with him and talk about the use cases and the data

Baldo from AEM might have a [[Color]] affinity model

Sayed is the EM

To dos:
- Talk to Jose
- connect w Sayed
	- let him know this shit is important and what we want 
- Look at the data and talk to Jose about what to do with it 


## Contextual stats and analytics #meetings 

### Notes
Our theory is:
*Contextualization will lead users to more useful assets, more easily and faster. This will cause higher CTR on elements, higher export and greater retention.* 

To quantify this thesis we'll need to prove: 
- **Users who place elements on a template export at a higher rate than those who do not**
	- Someone who customizes a template should in theory be more likley to export than someone who only changes text 
		- Quantify the ikea effect of the editor 
			- From [[Amanda Fetterly|Amanda]] on [[February 23, 2024]] 
				- Font's are sticky people will export more if they change or add text
			- Can we prove this for other element types?
- **Search CTR is higher than browse CTR**
	- Search should be more relevant than the static collections
	- Done yesterday (?)
- **Communicators who place elements from search have a relatively higher export than those who do not**
	- People who place elements on the page which they've indicated are relevant, tend to export more
		- If the export rate between the two is negligible, or people who only change text export more...we may have deeper editor problems 
			- "When Communicators are choosing templates, they are looking for remixability" - from [UXR report](https://adobegoldmine.com/pdfviewer.php?docid=AZ20220926010000020&datasource=ADBASAP&trans=view&caller=resultslist) 
	- Need to account for traffic difference between search and browse
- **Users who start from blank get frustrated and drop off mid creation**
	- People do not want to have to make a bunch of queries 
	- When do users rage quit 
		- Number of searches in sessions which export 
		- Vs number of searches in average session
		- CTR/export over session length


### meeting notes

Concern the results aren't great 

Tiered test
1. Test 1 would be one carousel
	1. Prove nothing racist happened 
2. Go to full takeover


For the AB test, what are the stats we're trying to track
get a baseline of these things now

focus on placement/CTR, we cannot control export 


overall asset usage should go up


- [x] Create wiki page with the stats I wrote up there (plus some specificity), and then the A/B test stats. What are the metrics we expect to go up when we launch, what signals will we be looking at. 


A/B criteria vs. the opportunity stats
