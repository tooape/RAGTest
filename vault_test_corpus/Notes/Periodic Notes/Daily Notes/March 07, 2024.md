## [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] Tech leads #meetings 

- [[Recommendations Home|Contextual photos]] [[Evaluation|eval]]
	- wrapping up last round 
	- starting the next one next week 

We'll need to work on stock once the query time intent service is ready. 
The service is going well



### Next round
We'll be using USS explorer, adding icon and design asset, still using the file, plus query changes from benjamin. 

Reasons this is delayed: 
- Jason is supposed to be doing this but ramali is leaving, and he has to pick up some slack
- Service
- New model 


### Graph improvements 
TO do's from kosta 1x1 
- [x] Graph improvements 
	- The manual shit 
	- The hierarchy clean up 
	- Meet with Priya 
	- How do we associate Lewis to F1, to Sport, to cars 
		- leaf to leaf associations 
	- Metadata 

- [x] asdf 

## Layouts #meetings 

- What we're trying to do 
	- Understand the layouts of canvas's and templates as a way of understanding the [[Style Home|style]] of the project
		- [Styles deck](https://xd.adobe.com/view/8a08fa1f-d628-4e50-ac91-6666c097dcaf-df5b/screen/7570c5fe-6cff-485b-a360-80ecf83e53ae)
		- Wiki page
	- Use cases for [[Layout & Spacing|layout]] 
		- [[Layout & Spacing|Layout]] is a powerful signal in understanding the [[Style Home|style]]
		- As a user works through a project they might need assistance in laying out projects in a way that's coherent with the [[Color|colors]] they've been working on, the [[Icons]], the copy, the [[typography|fonts]]. 
		- We need to understand [[Layout & Spacing|layout]] in order to understand [[Style Home|style]], and vice versa 


### Notes 
They took a pure machine learnign appraoch 
Accurate representation of a horizon project 

Come up with a minimal representation of a document, as a way of "compressing" a document's layout 

currently on v3.3 of their model

2 data sets
vegan
non vegan data - user project data 


the model is identifying the sections of the document, and then re-mixing them for fonts, colors, layouts. 

style works both ways, we can get the style out of [[CPT]], or give it a style to gen on 

they can ID duotone and colors, etc


### Next steps 

List of templates with the styles tagged, and then throw that at [[CPT]] to extract the style understanding




## Andrei #meetings/1x1 

Q2 feature alignment in express ongoing 
Design assets, shapes, backgrounds is after photos
assistance creating visually cohesive projects is a top pain point for customers in search and discover y

A lot of overlap with [[CPT]], and the assistive track. 

Need the color theme project, need the tempoX viewer 


bother amanda and katie about tempo access 

## By Yu #meetings/1x1 

- might need a graphDB if we get huge 
	- node count 100M+, and edges density 
	- GraphDBs are more expensive 

Francois is moving to be the relevance PM
