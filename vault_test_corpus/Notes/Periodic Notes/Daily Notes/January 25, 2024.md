## Kanban team sync #meetings 
- It's a board and process change that should make tracking the asks, and where we're spending our time a bit more clear. 
- There's no more points estimates, each ticket is considered roughly the same size of work, anything we get into and find out is too large will be broken up. 
- Each column will have a maximum number of tickets in progress. If a column is full, nothing else can be brought in until something else is pushed out. 
- Each column will also have a definition of what needs to be done with some task in order to move it out.
