**[[Query Understanding]]**
- [[Query Understanding|QU]] Roadshow for [[Lr Home|Lr]]

1. Work for [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] is clear, we're making progress
2. [[Vipul Dalal|Vipul]]'s message on [[Query Understanding|QU]] isn't very clear, and I feel there's misalignment between you, Vipul, and Venkat. [[Vipul Dalal|Vipul]] seems over cautious about specialization and his desire for a boiler plate to the point that we're unclear on how to move forward. 
	- I appreciate the cause
	- We keep getting pushed for "coverage" but told that we can't evaluate against product data sets. If the numerator is the number of concepts in [[CKG 4.0|CKG4]], what is the denominator. 
	- We need the MLE voice to come through more, we're being too platformized
		- [[Subhajit]] is a big help, and his voice is coming through more in these conversations. 
3. MM model work is clear, meeting with [[Asim Kadav|Asim]] and team regularly 

**Notes**

Not generica solutions: 
1. Core affinity → Express
2. sub prompt → DC
3. SRL → DC

**Questions**
1. what is the foundational model for these three ^ 
2. What is the point solution on top of that for each use case thing

- [ ] Just create a slide or a document outlining this 

- [ ] Can we take all the tags and tokens in the index and run a one off analysis on coverage?
	- DC deep search 
	- Lr autotagger/cat
	- Stock
	- How much of CKG will be covered with these tokens?

- [ ] How much of CKG 3.5 and 4.0 is covered in the offline intent set brian made? Slack message
