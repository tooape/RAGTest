- Template: urn:aaid:sc:VA6C2:8c4b41a3-4bff-55d6-887b-472cd7fa7909
	- Queries: Work party, Office happy hour
	- Note: Here we want to get that it's a more **casual** happy hour, there's likely to be drinks and hanging out, but it's not a big party. 
- Template: urn:aaid:sc:VA6C2:0d78107c-3d79-5e68-993d-5168163e264a
	- outdoor music festival, outdoor concert, music concert
	- Note: the template includes the word "pine" and shows a woman with an acoustic guitar, implying it's a bluegrass/folk type of concert, but since this is placeholder data we can ignore that and assume the user may be using this layout for a non-folk concert/festival. 
- Template: urn:aaid:sc:VA6C2:b2c2468e-c4be-5d9a-bf89-41cd27bc52fa
	- picking blueberries, pick blueberries, blueberry farm, picking berries, blueberries
	- Notes: Important to capture blueberries first and foremost, the act of picking is secondary. 
- Template: urn:aaid:sc:VA6C2:0a5f9edc-16bb-5f21-b7f9-12edeacfda30
	- indoor soccer, indoor soccer team, indoor soccer turf
	- Notes: important to capture this is indoor, an outdoor soccer pitch with full stands is not relevant 
- Template: urn:aaid:sc:VA6C2:e7ef4a80-9ebb-51be-9a48-7e8f93414580
	- Volleyball team, volleyball indoor, volleyball court
	- Note: location is a city gym, implying it's indoor and not beach vollyball. If the user were to change this location we may need to take beach or sand pit volleyball into account.
