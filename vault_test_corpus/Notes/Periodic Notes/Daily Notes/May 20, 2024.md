# Notes
---

Today: 
- [x] [[Color]] tickets for srini and rohith
- [x] Questions and need for design team tomorrow 
	- Create a page for the major problem areas to solve: 
		- UX
			- two ways to navigate information 
				- By topic, and by element 
		- Relevance
			- [[Color]] 

## Design questions 
- UX of contextualization results 
	- how many collections might we want to show?
		- Would we show any at all?
	- Would we display these results by topic, or by element type?
		- Just displaying the elements? 
			- Interleaving, etc
		- How much metadata will be shown? 
			- Will they be named in collections? etc? 
- Relevance 
	- The considerations around thresholding, number of associations to display, the logic of those associations 
	- How will we want to show [[Color]] cohesion?
		- Hard and fast, exploratory?
