Back on wedding slide, just the long search and generation case 

Based on [Express editor Contextual Discovery April FY24.mp4](https://adobe.sharepoint.com/:v:/r/sites/adobesearch/Shared%20Documents/Demos/2024%20SDC%20Stock%20and%20Express%20AI%20Demos/Express%20editor%20Contextual%20Discovery%20April%20FY24.mp4?csf=1&web=1&e=Z657Oz)

0:01 - highlight what the video is about 
0:34 - collapse regular left hand UI
0:41 - contextualization is related to "wedding" in talk track 
- then go into each individual tab in video 
- Don't add them
- then add branch and the services stuff

**Big questions**

2. Color cohesion 
3. What is the [[UX]] approach ?
4. How will we release?
