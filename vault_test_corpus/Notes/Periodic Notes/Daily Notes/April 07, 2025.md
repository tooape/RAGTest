I think we can be more efficient with our time if we modify exp6 to run [[Intent AI Home|mint]] embeddings for any query with 2 or more tokens. 

**Claude prompt to examine lr eval data so far**
![[Search Eval as of 4-7.xlsx]]

I need to analyze some data. First I will describe the context for the data, then I will outline the task I would like you to complete. 

<About the data>
This spreadsheet is collected feedback from a series of query analysis from various participants to find the best ranking strategy for an AI search project in Lightroom. The test was conducted by showing two results lists side by side for any query string the participant entered. The user was then asked to choose if the left column's strategy was better, or the right column's strategy. The user may also select that both, or neither query strategy was useful. The user was able to freely select from a list of available queries strategies which column would use what strategy. I need to analyze this data. It has 4 columns: 

Col A is "queryString" which is the list of query Strings
Col B is "user_feedback" which is the participant's preferred query strategy represented as which column they preferred
Col C is "leftVariant" the strategy that the user selected to show in the left column 
Col D is the "rightVariant" which is the strategy the user selected to show in the right column 

The names of the strategies in the C and D columns may not make sense, but this is ok. Please continue to use the varient names in these columns as they are written. 
</About the data>


<My task>
I would like to understand the most perfeered strategy for different lengths of query by token count. 
</My task>

<Expected analysis>
Produce a report which outlines which query strategies are best for each length of query up to 4 tokens. 
</Expected analysis>
