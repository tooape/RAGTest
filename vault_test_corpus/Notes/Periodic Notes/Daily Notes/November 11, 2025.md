- Created [[QU Demo Interface Requirements]] for Venkat and Shudakar - internal demo interface to visualize full [[Query Understanding]] intelligence outputs 

[[Tracy King|Tracy]] thought for [[Lr Home|Lr]] semantic search on single tokens we could try just adding "photos" as a query expansion thing to just see if it outperforms cat.

## [[Brian Eriksson|Brian]] feedback:
**Doing well**
[[Brian Eriksson|Brian]] is an excellent leader who has consistently prioritized the right initiatives and relationships for his org. He's biased towards action and impact, but does not chase every random opportunity that pops up. He's very intentional and clear in his prioritization and communication. 

**Do differently**
[[Brian Eriksson|Brian]] is very current in search, generation, and ML research. As bandwidth allows now that [[Kosta Blank|Kosta]] is stepping in for the day-to-day on [[Recommendations Home|recommendations]] I'd love to see [[Brian Eriksson|Brian]] push more future facing tech investments with that discernment I mentioned above. 

**Otherwise**
I really enjoy working with [[Brian Eriksson|Brian]]. He's exceptionally capable as an eng leader, and a great communicator/collaborator. Looking forward to rolling out our future bets in [[Style Home|style]] and [[Personalization Home|personalization]] in 2026 with him.
