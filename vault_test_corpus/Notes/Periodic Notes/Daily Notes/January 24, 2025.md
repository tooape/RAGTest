## video intent demo #meetings 

- Reason for call: share prototype video model
- Intro to current video model
	- Rudimentary sampling approach, not fine tuned or optimized really at all 
	- Averaging of intent embedding across a range of sampled frames from the spec'd time window
	- We've got a lot of ideas about where to go next, but we wanted to check back in with y'all before we went too far down the road
- Run a demo
- Q&A
- Their timeline 
### use cases
1. IDing when things happen in a video and just flagging "moments". 
	1. Chapter segmentation 
use the text as-is to just show when things are happening
2. actual [[Recommendations Home|recs]]
3. taking a template, crawling "your stuff" to find a good matching video

**Next steps:**
- they're putting a [video use cases wiki](https://wiki.corp.adobe.com/display/cclight/Video+Intent+Model+for+Express) together 
- Lisa and I will do some design thinking about how we might do this
- they'll provide some sample videos
