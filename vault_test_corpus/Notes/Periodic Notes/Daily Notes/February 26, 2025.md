### updating it 


The Intent & Language AI workstream strengthens SDC’s AI foundation by enabling context-aware, multimodal search, discovery, and [[Recommendations Home|recommendations]]. Traditional methods fall short in truly understanding user goals, but Intent Understanding leverages Creative [[Intent AI Home|Knowledge Graph]] ([[Intent AI Home|CKG]]) and Multi-modal Intent ([[Intent AI Home|MINT]]) to decode user intent from text, images, and video. This enhances content, design, and user intelligence, improving relevance, retrieval, and ranking across Adobe’s ecosystem. By embedding multilingual and culturally aware intelligence, it ensures scalable, adaptive AI-driven experiences. Ultimately, this workstream makes SDC’s AI systems smarter, more proactive, and deeply aligned with user needs.



## [[Brian Eriksson|Brian]] #meetings 

- Anti-goals more called out 
	- SDC scope limits right off the bat

- alignment with SDC tech and use cases

show that the correct buger is in there, but it's the 800th result 
- we have the contnet but we're not returning it properly in express
- "there's XXXX asstsz in sotck we must ave whater" but we dont show it **this is a high precision search problem** 

we need technolgy to solove this problem, but we're not biling the ocean ehre. 
- we're not solving "what does minimalist look like"

having this [[Style Home|style]] embedding space now allows us to understand the conenctions and correlations. which will power this semantic understanding later

here's what you get fro your investment. 



1. up front show the broad landscape
	1. take it and mark out what we're not doing 
	2. Validation of humility 
	3. we'd love to do all this, but we're not there yet 
2. Heres how the aesthetic understanding the way we're definig it will get us there.
