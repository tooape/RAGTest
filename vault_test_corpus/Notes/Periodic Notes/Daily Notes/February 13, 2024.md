## [[Ritu Goel|Ritu]] #meetings/1x1 

### Feeling like an uninvited house guest 
- This [[Artemis]] re-prioritization 
- [[Ravindra Sadaphule|Ravindra]] sharing March 19th 
	- And the internal [[Evaluation|eval]] promise to [[Vipul Dalal|Vipul]] 

I feel like I have to chase folks down to involve me in product decisions. If I have some meeting with these folks, and the team, if Vipul or Ravindra say something in another channel or a 1x1, whatever we previously discussed gets thrown out the window, and I don't find out until a couple days later when all of a sudden some new code change is done or like this morning when apparently artemis is a big priority. I end up running around doing a lot of admin work or writing a wiki page for something that's already half done. 

I kind of get the feeling CKG dosn't want a PM, and I'm having to really battle my way from the fringes into any kind of real role here. I can only help drive requirements, focus, communication, or strategy, etc about the things I know about.

At first I wondered if it was a lack of trust, or lack of knowledge my part that I need to block time to go address. But now i'm thinking if that's just the leadership styles/personalities at play in SDC. But as it is right now I'm spending a lot of time chasing engineering around. I've also found im not the only one having some friction here because I see a real loss of the feeling of ownership among Kosta/Jayant. Same thing at the individual engineer level i've seen really basic things like duplicate nodes get missed. I think a lot of people feel pretty yanked around. 

## Kosta #meetings/1x1 

- Ritu's feedback about just being noiser
- the return of the 6 week plan 

- Being more forceful 
- Talking to Shilpi and Sneha about organizing the work in Jira for contextual and making it clear what CKG is working on 
-
