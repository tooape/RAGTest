## Three pillars of understanding 
The mental model for CKG is to be an art tutor. Your art tutor will need to have a few areas of knowledge to be helpful to you in guiding your creation. They'll need to understand paining, and art theory. They know you and your prior work with them. They know what paints and brushes are in the studio. 
This is what we'll need.

Creative understanding will require knowledge of: 
- The User's actions
- The Creation 
- The Ecosystem of tools and data 

Breaking this down along service lines we get:

|                         | Intent Services          | [[CPT]]            | User Service                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| User Understanding      |                          |                | Entitlements<br>Cloud Docs <br>- (Hz, Lr, Ps, squirrel, etc) |
| Creation Understanding  | MM Model<br>Style Engine | CML Extraction | Editor behavior<br>Query log<br>Export history               |
| Ecosystem Understanding | QIT Model <br>QPIE Model |                | Product Usage                                                |

These services will need to be able to interoperate with each other to share their respective pilliars of understanding. CKG will become a connective glue that holds these things together. 

**eg. 1:** 
A user logs into express, makes a query, edits a template, and exports. 
This on it's own isn't super useful, because we don't know what they did, or what the template was about. We need to understand the asset, and the ecosystem as well. 



# Meetings

## [[Kosta Blank|Kosta]] #meetings/1x1 

Sometimes I feel a little disconnected or out in space on some of the going's on. If that's just how the team likes to work I don't need to insert myself into the minutae of decision making, but sometimes I worry im just not heard about questions that need my input. 

In either case How do I better stay up to date on changes that are happening to models? 
I had no idea we'd trained something over the weekend. 

Graph improvements 
- As we wind down on coverage improvements (2 tickets left) can we start pulling in some of the tickets we've talked about with the deny list, etc 

Mock ups 

Modular approach to the intent engine

### Creative knowledge & Content Intelligence 

I've been characterizing [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] as trying to understand 3 pilliars of knowledge: 
- The user's actions, past and current 
- The canvas, the assets in it
- Data in the adobe ecosystem 

[[CPT]] has done a lot of work on canvas / asset understanding 
- [[CPT]] vs [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] for layouts 
	- The model will look a bit like [[RAG]]
		- They also have some [[Color]] understanding
	- Am I stepping on toes here? 
- Who's the PM for [[CPT]]?

CML topics & [[Color]] understanding


### Testing and evals 
- whats next after we have this model 
	- Getting photos to a really good place 

- Extension vs [[Intent AI Home|CKG]] explore 
	- Rohith said you wanted to put thumbsup/down in the ext ui?
	- Non deterministic testing

We have got to get more rigorous about learn to rank (or learn to associate), and bandit optimization techniques. Over reliance on GPT is killing our quality left and right, and the graph is too big to go line by line and build associations. 

Peng min? 
Talking to [[Tracy King|Tracy]] about ML ranker for [[Express]]. 

### Notes
Starting recomendations by pills instead of going straight to recomeding photos/assets etc
