Ran more photostyle evals on the after images from the cooper set. 

Need to slow down the [[Smart Connections Enhancement - Custom RAG]] health checks. 


Building a high precision ranker for [[Lr Home|Lr]], early ranker for just saying "are you relevant or are you not?".
Cutting the match set. 

For people and animals we just need to push the human results above the animal ones. By way of people searching their own catalogs, they should be able to filter out the irrelevant results. Once we have a HPR the ethics issues they had should go away. 

**[[Photoshop|Ps Web]] [[Recommendations Home|Recs]]**
