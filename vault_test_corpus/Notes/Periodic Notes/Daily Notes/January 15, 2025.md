## Ritu #meetings/1x1

- talk about the [MINT program page](https://wiki.corp.adobe.com/display/adobesearch/SDC+Intent+Understanding+Program)

**Roadmap and role ambiguity** 
[[Intent AI Home|MINT]] vs [[ILUP]] vs [[Recommendations Home|Recs]]
confirm my understanding 


## Brian #meetings/1x1 

- us working on [[Recommendations Home|recs]] together 
- Style going to the content AI team eventually 
	- But ritu said we should keep working on it for now 
- personalization is fine but no foundational capture stuff, we're just consumers

style
personal
video 

- [x] Re-running video to intent demo with hep and Lisa 
	- Are these the right things to show in [[Recommendations Home|contextual recs]], or do they need to be more biased towards embelishments
