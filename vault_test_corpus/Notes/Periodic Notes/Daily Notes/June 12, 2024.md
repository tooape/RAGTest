[[Intent AI Home|CKG]]: characterization 
- whole structure is wrong 

1. descriptior hierachy for [[Compositional intents|compositionality]] 
	1. demonyms 
2. Cleaning up dupes
3. Manual structuring nodes 
	1. Months, locations, etc
4. Better definitions of things like scene objects
5. locations 

Technology as scene object
- website
- apps
- etc
