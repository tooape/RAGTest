## [[Recommendations Home|Recs]] standup #meetings

- Getting the machine translation into [[ILUP]] for the [[Acrobat|DC]] test
## [[Brian Eriksson|Brian]] #meetings/1x1 

- Meeting with Vic 
	- Just user her comment and ticket for [[Style Home|style]] to get Venkat's buy in 

- cutting off the oxygen comment 
	- is [[Vipul Dalal|vipul]] feeling like he leaving [[govind]]'s org? Does [[govind]] not care anymore?

### Photo [[Style Home|style]] 
memphis vs googie how is your experience different if you're working on one vs the other? Make a mock canvas in [[Photoshop|Ps Web]] where a HP5 B/W file and an XP2 file would be different. 


## Anuj #meetings/1x1 

1. progress on tracking - Anuj reaching out
2. mock data - pinging them again 
3. instrumenting opt-out flow 
## [[Tracy King|Tracy]] #meetings/1x1 

- For automated [[Lr Home|Lr]] testing Picking a top k results for some query and then measure the overlap between rankerV1 and rankerV2 and if the overlap is too small between them, trigger something. 
- Breaking the query set out by tokens or types of metadata 
	- Break down of what went wrong by these categoies
	- set flags for these different areas

These are just sanity check for "did we drop a field". 

Updating the baseline occasionally as we go 

Updating an on call list of these in the event they push some update that blows up relevancy . 

Alerting for behavioral shifts
- trailing day or something if the CTR or null rate blows up
