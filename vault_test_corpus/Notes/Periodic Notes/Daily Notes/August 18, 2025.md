## Quick chat with Shubajit #meetings/1x1 

His questions from slack:
- We had already developed an Asset Type affinity model based on clicks etc. and it seems it is  in production.
    - Would you be knowing what all features are using it today/have used it  to drive some end-user experience?
    -  What were the learnings from this production launch?
