## [[Style Home]] thoughts

[[Color]] and pallets are V1. 

For V2 we still need to avoid the naming and semantics of [[Style Home|style]] issues, so we can move forward with the split embedding approach. 
- [x] Write requirements 

We'll start with stock, and simply see if we can group [[Style Home]] in abstract of their subject matter. 
Skip photography for now, focus on design assets ([illustrations in stock](https://stock.adobe.com/illustrations)) and "[graphic resources](https://stock.adobe.com/search?filters%5Bcontent_type:photo%5D=1&filters%5Bcontent_type:illustration%5D=1&filters%5Bcontent_type:zip_vector%5D=1&filters%5Bcontent_type:video%5D=1&filters%5Bcontent_type:template%5D=1&filters%5Bcontent_type:3d%5D=1&filters%5Bcontent_type:audio%5D=0&filters%5Bfetch_excluded_assets%5D=1&filters%5Binclude_stock_enterprise%5D=1&filters%5Bis_editorial%5D=0&ca=444&load_type=category&prev_url=detail&search_type=category-link-details-panel)" as this is likely the hardest. 
Additionally, I'm not sure photos in stock will be the best training set. The commercial nature of a stock marketplace will limit how stylistic these photos will get, or what kinds of photos will be added there. Training on this might help with ranking things in the photos tab in [[Express]], but an [[Artemis]] use case might not be served well here.

[[Evaluation|Eval]]: 
Produce a matrix of 10 subjects and 10 [[Style Home]]. 
Get two [[Evaluation]]: 
- How different are the [[Style Home]] across one subject class
- How similar are the [[Style Home]] within one [[Style Home|style]] class across all subjects. 

[[Evaluation|Eval]] 2: 
Find a creator who has a strong visual [[Style Home|style]] (I like [Enso](https://stock.adobe.com/contributor/208742119/enso?load_type=author&prev_url=detail&asset_id=612161459)), see if we caan re-create a collection/series of their work with the model.
