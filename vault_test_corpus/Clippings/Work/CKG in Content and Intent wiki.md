**Summary**
This document outlines the **[[Intent AI Home|Common Knowledge Graph]] (CKG) Q4 2025 plans**, focusing on comprehensive development and requiring further detailed breakdown and owner assignments. It covers two main swimlanes: **Graph Enrichment** (for core CKG development, editing, modeling, and domain specialization) and **Content and CKG** (for developing [[Intent AI Home|embedder models]] for documents and queries, and grounding assets to the graph). 

**Highlights**
> 

**Details**
- **Overall Goal:** Capture comprehensive CKG Q4 2025 plans, requiring detailed breakdowns and owner assignments.
- **Swimlane 1: Graph Enrichment:** Focuses on developing/maturing capabilities to enrich the CKG, including workflows for adding/deleting/editing graph elements, developing a foundational GNN model, and specializing the graph to specific domains.
- **Swimlane 2: Content and CKG:** Focuses on adopting/adapting/developing [[Intent AI Home|embedder models]] for documents (image, text, video, audio) and queries (multi-modal, prompt-conditioned encoder/decoder models that can use graph signals).
- **Key Deliverables (Swimlane 1):** Modules for generating and verifying candidate graph edits, GNN model output, and workflows for domain specialization.
- **Key Deliverables (Swimlane 2):** Query-side multi-modal models for [[Query Understanding|semantic retrieval]] and grounding to graph nodes, and mechanisms for grounding assets/documents to graph nodes/relations.
