This Adobe Wiki page outlines the \\"[[Style Home|Style]] Understanding Strategy\\" within Adobe Search and Discovery & Content AI (SDC). The strategy aims to improve search relevance and [[Recommendations Home|recommendations]] by incorporating a nuanced understanding of visual [[Style Home|style]], addressing the limitations of current semantic search and canonical [[Style Home|style]] definitions.

- **Problem:** Users struggle to find stylistically relevant content due to subjective design terminology and inadequate [[Query Understanding|semantic search]], impacting precision in [[Query Understanding|search]], [[Recommendations Home|recommendations]], and agent replies.
- **Strategy Phase 1 (Current Focus): Asset [[Style Home|Style]] Similarity:** Develop an embedding space that captures [[Style Home|style]] qualities between assets, independent of their semantic content, to provide supplementary signals for [[Query Understanding|search]] and [[Recommendations Home|recommender systems]].
- **Strategy Phase 2 (Next Step): Compositional [[Style Home|Style]]:** Leverage the [[Style Home|style embedding space]] to understand relative [[Style Home|style]] across multiple assets and types within a template or canvas, enabling [[Style Home|style]]-aware editor search and cohesive [[Recommendations Home|recommendations]].
- **Future Evolution:** Progress towards semantic understanding of [[Style Home|style]] (allowing natural language queries for [[Style Home|style]]) and visual cohesion (integrating understanding of [[Style Home|color]] harmony and layout).
