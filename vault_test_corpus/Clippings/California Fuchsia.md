This page provides a detailed profile of the California Fuchsia (*Epilobium canum*), a perennial herb native to California. It highlights the plant's characteristics, cultivation needs, and ecological benefits.

*   **Key Features:** Bright scarlet flowers in summer/fall, attracts hummingbirds.
*   **Cultivation:** Easy to grow, prefers full sun, tolerant of various soils, requires pruning after flowering.
*   **Benefits:** Fire-resistant, supports various wildlife including butterflies and moths.


**Highlights**
> They tend to die back and go dormant in the winter
> 
> Other common names include California Fuchsia (from the resemblance of the flowers to those of Fuchsias), Hummingbird Flower, and Hummingbird Trumpet (as the flowers are very attractive to hummingbirds).
> 
> In the wetter, northern part of its range or near the coast, this plant will typically require no supplemental water after established. In the drier, hotter, inland southern areas, it will often die without summer water unless planted close to an irrigated or other wet area. You can water it 1x/month without much danger.
> 
> Plants tend to get straggly after flowering by late fall or early winter. Best to cut it back to the ground as soon as the flowers are spent, and it will come back back lush and healthy in the spring. Otherwise, it will look straggly and unhealthy the next year and is more likely to die.
