This page explains the USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map (PHZM), a tool for gardeners and plant suppliers. It details how the zones are interpreted and used, noting that they are general guides based on average annual extreme minimum winter temperatures. The page also highlights other environmental factors crucial for plant survival and provides instructions for navigating the interactive map.

- Zones are based on the average annual extreme minimum winter temperature.
- Each zone is divided into 'a' and 'b' half zones (e.g., 7a, 7b).
- Many environmental factors beyond zones affect plant success, such as light, soil moisture, wind, and humidity.


**Highlights**
> The Plant Hardiness Zone Map (PHZM) is based on the average annual extreme minimum winter temperature, displayed as 10-degree F zones ranging from zone 1 (coldest) to zone 13 (warmest).  Each zone is divided into half zones designated as ‘a’ and ‘b’.  For example, 7a and 7b are 5-degree F increments representing the colder and warmer halves of zone 7, respectively.
