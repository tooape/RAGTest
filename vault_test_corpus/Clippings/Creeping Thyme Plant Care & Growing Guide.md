# [Creeping Thyme: Plant Care & Growing Guide](https://www.thespruce.com/types-of-creeping-thyme-2132329)

[[September 28, 2025]] 

The article provides a detailed guide on growing and caring for creeping thyme, a low-maintenance, deer-resistant flowering ground cover known for its fine texture and aromatic leaves. It covers planting, environmental needs, propagation, pruning, and troubleshooting common issues.

*   Thrives in full sun and well-draining, sandy soil.
*   Hardy in USDA zones 2-9.
*   Propagated by division, stem cuttings, or from seed.


**Highlights**
> Keep your creeping thyme plant in full sun.
> 
> It doesn't like wet feet, so make sure the soil drains well. It loves loose, sandy, rocky soil, and even loam if it drains well. It does not do well in [wet clay](https://www.thespruce.com/plants-that-grow-in-clay-soil-4165330).
> 
> Do not let creeping thyme get parched, especially when it's a young plant. For the most part, thyme planted in the ground or maintained at a steady, non-sweltering temperature should only need watering every 10 days; however, potted thyme outdoors in blazing hot temperatures will need watering once daily.
> 
> Creeping thyme growing in well-prepared soil shouldn't need to be fed.
