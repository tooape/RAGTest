# The Manager's Path - Camille Fournier
---

## Overview

**Author**: Camille Fournier (former CTO at Rent the Runway)

**Core Premise**: A practical guide for tech leaders navigating the transition from individual contributor to manager, covering the six levels of engineering management career ladder.

**Why This Book**: Most tactical guide for first-time managers, focusing on "how do I run a 1:1" rather than inspirational leadership concepts. Particularly valuable for technical transitions.

## Career Ladder Stages

1. **Mentoring** - First managerial experience (mentor to intern/new hire)
2. **Tech Lead** - Continue writing code while representing group to management
3. **Engineering Lead** (Junior Management)
4. **Engineering Director**
5. **Managing Managers**
6. **Senior Executive Leadership**

## Key Concepts

### 1. One-on-Ones
"Regular 1-1s are like oil changes; if you skip them, plan to get stranded on the side of the highway at the worst possible time."

### 2. Feedback and Growth
Good managers actively invest in growth through:
- Regular meetings with continuous feedback (positive and constructive)
- Helping team members improve
- Not waiting for formal review cycles

### 3. Staying Technical
Critically important for engineering leads to maintain technical credibility and context.

### 4. Personal Responsibility
Your workplace happiness is your responsibility. You set the tone for your relationship with your manager, just as they do.

### 5. Core Management Skills
Three skills for success:
- **Clear communication**
- **Strategic planning**
- **Adaptability**

## Relevance for PM Transition

While written for engineering managers, the frameworks apply directly to PM management:
- 1:1 structure and cadence
- Feedback mechanisms
- Transition from IC to manager mindset
- Managing across the career ladder
